03/28/2012,"[('Mike Mussina elected to the Orioles Hall of Fame', "" There's no doubt that Mike Mussina is a divisive figure in Orioles history. There is also no doubt that he's one of the best baseball players to ever put on an Orioles uniform. It was announced this morning that he, along with Rich Dauer and former scout Walter Youse, will be inducted into the Orioles Hall of Fame on August 24th. Some people will never be able to get over Mussina leaving the Orioles for the Yankees, and while it made me very sad at the time, that's life. Mussina did what was best for his career and it's hard to argue with that. For the people who do continue to hold a grudge, I'm sorry that they can't look back at Mussina's time with the Orioles (I mean, do you remember the 1997 post season? Holy cow) and just enjoy him for the gem that he was. Mussina met with media today via conference call and had these classy words to say:  Looking back, I can understand people being upset, frustrated and bitter. Especially when you leave Baltimore and go to a rival city in the same division. I can understand that. It was a decision that I made at the time and it probably worked out for me. But the first 10 years in Baltimore can't be replaced and nothing was more fun or exciting or enjoyable for me than being the last couple of players to get to play in Memorial Stadium and then move into a brand-new park. It was such a thrill to go and have a full house every day and to be in contention for a long stretch of time and to put us in the playoffs for the first time in a long time. There are so many things that were exciting and memorable and that I'm going to never forget. The Orioles were the ones that gave me the chance to experience that. If people are upset that I made a change, they are allowed to be upset. People take this stuff really personally sometimes, but honestly, the first ten years in the major leagues were a great ten years. I thoroughly enjoyed it.     The Orioles Hall of Fame often seems that it's more about fan favorites (ahem, Mike Bordick) than it actually is about the caliber of player who played for the Orioles. But it's still a Hall of Fame, and any O's Hall of Fame without Mike Mussina in it is a joke.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to imagine the Orioles releasing Eveland, so he\xe2\x80\x99ll end up at Norfolk if he clears \xe2\x80\x93 Eveland said that likely would be his inclination as well.But, again, I think Duquette has something brewing. He mentioned he has had some \xe2\x80\x9ctertiary\xe2\x80\x9d trade talk in terms of thinning out the roster but wasn\xe2\x80\x99t talking in specifics. Based on the word tertiary, I\xe2\x80\x99m assuming it\xe2\x80\x99s not a blockbuster in limbo.  \xc2\xa0  Here are some highlights of Duquette\xe2\x80\x99s interview: var adSkipCounter = 0; Duquette on Wheeler: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a very good leader and he has increased his slugging percentage last year by like 60 points. And he has good command of the strike zone. His best position is third base, he is a good defender. And we were interested in him for his leadership capabilities, his on-base capabilities and his defense at third.\xe2\x80\x9dDuquette said Wheeler wouldn\'t necessarily be Norfolk\xe2\x80\x99s starting third baseman. The Tides still have Josh Bell, who is on the 40-man roster and was once considered a top prospect, though that star has faded some within the organization.Duquette said Wheeler was signed by Joe Mason, who once worked for Duquette in Boston and signed Jonathan Papelbon: \xe2\x80\x9cHe is a terrific scout and sees the ability in players, and a lot of times they end up getting to the big leagues, not right away, but later on.\xe2\x80\x9dOn designating Eveland, whom he gave up two minor leaguers to acquire in December: \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s been designated, and we\xe2\x80\x99ve got about 10 days to resolve that assignment. He is a qualified major leaguer. He just hasn\xe2\x80\x99t quite found a home yet.\xe2\x80\x9dMore on Eveland: \xe2\x80\x9cI still think Eveland is a qualified major league pitcher, but we did sign two lefties after we signed him.\xc2\xa0 He has been designated. Not a lot I can say about that until it gets resolved.\xe2\x80\x9dOn how the 25-man roster is coming along: \xe2\x80\x9cWhat are we down to 32 [in camp]? So we\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple of spots left to fill and we have some players we need to decide what their assignment will be. We are down to a couple spots.\xe2\x80\x9dOn making more moves for the roster: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have a few player contracts we need to resolve in camp, and we have had some tertiary trade discussions, so we will see.\xe2\x80\x9dOn whether he has closed the door on some of the available big-name free agents such as Johnny Damon, Hideki Matsui and Joel Piniero: \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know.

The O\'s website says it\'s also on MLB.TV, so presumably you can get a Yankees broadcast if you want, although I can\'t fathom why you would inflict that upon yourself. Anyway, Bird Droppings has over a thousand comments, so let\'s talk about the game somewhere else. Yesterday\'s game against Toronto featured something like zero regular position players. Today\'s lineup is a lot more representative of something we might see in the regular season: Reimold, Johnson (DH), Markakis, Jones, Wieters, Reynolds, Davis, Andino (SS), Flaherty (2B). The starting pitcher is Jason Hammel. According to Roch Kubatko, J.J. Hardy received a cortisone injection in his shoulder due to ""lingering discomfort"" on Tuesday and he is sitting out tonight as a precaution. He says if it was the regular season he would be playing for sure, but since it\'s spring he might as well take time out. Endy Chavez is still out of the lineup, having been day-to-day with a groin injury for at least a week. The Yankees are also playing some guys who I hate by virtue of their being on the Yankees: Jeter, Granderson (DH), Rodriguez, Teixeira, Ibanez (LF), Jones (RF), Gardner (CF), Nunez (2B), Cervelli. Their pitcher is David Phelps. I had no idea who that was so I looked at his Baseball Reference page. Turns out he was a 14th round pick from Notre Dame in the 2008 draft. (The Orioles selected Jesse Beal in that round.) He is 25 and in four minor league seasons, about 500 IP in all, he\'s put up a 2.61 ERA. Not a bad show.

(AP Photo/Charles Krupa)MoreSARASOTA, Fla. (AP) Baltimore Orioles left-hander Brian Matusz kept hitting 92 mph with his fastball in the first inning Friday, and the Detroit Tigers kept hitting him.The first four Tigers reached base on three singles and Miguel Cabrera's two-run double to right field. Matusz eventually settled down, retiring the last nine batters he faced in Detroit's 6-4 victory.Cabrera went 2 for 3 with two RBIs in his first game since being hit in the face by a sharp bouncer 11 days earlier.Tony Plagman tied it with a seventh-inning homer and hit a tiebreaking, two-run triple off Orioles reliever Jim Johnson in the ninth. Johnson, who is competing for the closer's job against Kevin Gregg, has a 7.71 ERA this spring.Matusz gave up three runs, a walk and five hits in five innings. He struck out four.''Just came out of the gates amped up with a lot of energy,'' Matusz said. ''The first inning, it killed me not getting ahead in the count. Gave up some two-strike hits. After that first inning, I was able to shake it off and just get back to work with (catcher Matt) Wieters. I really found a nice rhythm.''I felt just as strong in the fifth inning as I did in the first,'' he said. ''I was able to get my pitch count up and I was able to iron out the mechanical adjustments I've needed to.''Matusz is the favorite to break camp as the Orioles' fifth starter, but manager Buck Showalter hasn't confirmed it. Matusz's chief competitor for the last rotation spot, Japanese left-hander Tsuyoshi Wada, will pitch Tuesday in an exhibition game against the State College of Florida.The Orioles could choose to put Wada on the disabled list and leave him at extended spring training. He was sidelined early in camp with inflammation in his left elbow and is attempting to build up innings and his pitch count during the final week. He doesn't appear to be a bullpen option, since the Orioles don't want him adapting to a new role while also getting acclimated to pitching in the majors for the first time.Matusz was coming off a disappointing outing Sunday, when he allowed three runs and six hits in 4 2-3 innings against the Philadelphia Phillies. In three previous starts, he surrendered only one run in 13 innings, walked one and struck out 13.Matusz struck out two batters in the second inning Friday, but a throwing error by third baseman Mark Reynolds increased his pitch count. On the plus side, Matusz's fastball topped out at 93 mph. He rarely broke 90 mph last season while going 1-9 with a 10.69 ERA in 12 starts.Cabrera doubled again in the third and Matusz walked Don Kelly before retiring the next nine batters. He needed only five pitches to get through the fourth and 10 to complete the fifth.''You know, I did what I needed to this spring in order to go out and continue to build up my pitch count and get comfortable on the mound again,'' Matusz said. ''I feel like I've built my pitch count up and I'm strong and I've made the adjustments I've needed to mechanically and I feel like I'm on the right track to prepare myself for the season.''Adam Jones hit his fourth spring home run leading off the third inning - the Orioles' first hit off Tigers' left-hander Duane Below. Baltimore tied it in the fourth on an RBI single by Endy Chavez, who was playing in his first game since March 21 after injuring his groin.Below, a candidate for the Tigers' fifth starter job, walked four batters in the second inning, with Robert Andino's free pass forcing in Reynolds and reducing Detroit's lead to 3-1.''I just got out of rhythm, kind of starting rushing myself I guess, and I just didn't make the adjustment,'' Below said. ''Everybody kind of just unraveled a little bit.''Below allowed three runs, three hits and four walks in 3 1-3 innings.''I just couldn't locate my fastball,'' he said. ''I didn't throw any other pitches to try to get back to my arm slot or slow myself down. I was just rushing everything today. That's not really the start I wanted to have my last start of the spring. It's frustrating. Especially as we got out to an early lead, my goal was to attack the strike zone and get as many quick outs as possible, keep our guys out of the sun. That just didn't work for me.''NOTES: The Orioles will place backup catcher Taylor Teagarden on the 15-day disabled list with discomfort in his lower back. He'll be eligible to return on April 10. Teagarden will have a second epidural on his back Monday morning. ... Orioles pitcher Matt Lindstrom (hamstring) was scratched from Friday's game and will make his next appearance in a minor league game. ... Detroit reassigned catcher Omir Santos to minor league camp. The Tigers have 30 players remaining on the major league camp roster. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Best Orioles Move this Offseason: Saying Goodbye to Joe Jordan', 'For the past seven seasons, Joe Jordan has served the Orioles as the Amateur Scouting Director. At this current moment the Orioles have only a few homegrown players on the current 25-man roster. Jordan was in charge of player development through the minor leagues and most importantly was the man making the calls on draft day.Billie WeissDuring the last 14 seasons the Orioles results have been monotonous. They have finished below .500 each and every year. When Andy Macphail took the helm four years ago there was much reason for optimism. His new rebuilding philosophy of growing the arms and buying the bats had most fans believing that the end result would culminate into success. As we found out four years later, most of the pitching prospects are unproven and the Orioles farm system is now depleted of all but a few good prospects.That brings me to Joe Jordan. It\xe2\x80\x99s hard to fathom that a team could not attain 81 wins for over a decade. Jordan has surprisingly been under the radar as far as blame for the Orioles catastrophe. Here is why Joe Jordan is an integral reason for the major setback.In the first round of the 2005 first year player draft Jordan selected high school catcher Brandon Snyder. To his defense, Jordan was highly interested in 2 outfielders in Andrew McCutchen and Jay Bruce and they were drafted at the slots above the Orioles. Snyder never made it full time with the Orioles and at best seemed like he would be a backup corner infielder.Who Could They have Instead? Chris Volstad SP(Marlins), Jacoby Ellsbury CF(Red Sox )2006 is the year which I regard as the classic reason why the Orioles are what they are today. The Orioles held the 9th overall selection in the draft and when on the clock Jordan and his colleagues selected high school 3rd baseman Billy Rowell. Rowell was described as a very raw but intriguing talent. He had a solid arm and maintained good defensive skills and his bat contained alot of pop. To say the least in 2012 Rowell is a complete bust. A total disaster. Rowell has struggled in every facet of the game. He could not keep his job at 3rd base and struggled mightily at the plate. It took Rowell 5 years to get past single A. Now in double A, Rowell is playing the outfield and still seems as though he will never figure it out.David J. Phillip/APOkay Fine, so he\xe2\x80\x99s a bust no big deal right? Dead wrong. What makes the Rowell pick even worse is the player who was drafted directly after him. With the 10th pick in the 2006 MLB draft the Giants settled by drafting a 5\xe2\x80\x9911 right handed pitcher with a quirky delivery out of the University of Washington. His name is Tim Lincecum. Thats a killer, just no way to feel good about it. The Orioles gave a future complete Ace and Cy Young award winner to a guy who can\xe2\x80\x99t hit or field.Who Could They have Instead? Tim Lincecum SP (SF Giants), Max Scherzer SP(*Arizona D-backs) Ian Kennedy SP (*New York Yankees), Kyle Drabek SP/SS(*Philadelphia Philles)2006 is a year that will continue to haunt the Orioles for a while. In the 2nd round they took Ryan Adams a 3rd baseman out of Jesuit high school over pitchers Trevor Cahill and Justin Masterson, and outfielder Jon Jay.It seemed as though Joe Jordan never had a stable draft philosophy. He seemed to alternate from drafting for needy positions to drafting the best player available to drafting the player who won\xe2\x80\x99t demand alot of money.After 2006 Jordan seemed to want to take the college route in drafting. In 2007 and 2008 the Orioles drafted catcher Matt Wieters and starting pitcher Brian Matusz, both the best players available and played in college. Both flew threw the minor leagues and dominated at each level. Though the first round picks were strong, the later round picks have yet to produce much talent.From seeing the success of Wieters and Matusz it seemed logical that the Orioles would continue to draft the best player available. My final argument describing my dislike for Joe Jordan came in 2009. The Orioles had the 5th selection in the draft and when on the clock seemed like they would take the BPA in Zack Wheeler. Wheeler possesses a delivery that can be compared to Tim Lincecums and personally thought the Orioles had a chance to redeem themselves by not drafting Lincecum 4 years earlier, but that was not the case\xe2\x80\xa6Tom Priddy/Four Seam ImagesThe Orioles drafted Matt Hobgood. Who? What? Matt Hobgood? Yes, Matt Hobgood. In most draft analysts boards he was projected to be picked in the middle of the first round, but Jordan took him at number 5. Hobgood reminded me of Joba Chamberlain who at his best was a shutdown 8th inning guy. You dont draft those guys at number 5 overall. Since he signed Hobgood has posted an ERA over 5 and has yet to make it to High A ball. He has had constant injuries and his 98 MPH fastball has dropped in velocity. Hobgood will be out for the entire 2012 season.This was the end of the road for me with Jordan. How can the average fan not recognize the disastrous farm system this man was providing us? The Orioles best farm years were when they had Matusz, Wieters, Tillman, Arrietta, Bergesen and Britton down there. Once they made it to the big leagues we had no one else.As for Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s last draft with the Orioles, he took Vanderbilt 3rd baseman Jason Esposito in the 2nd round. A pick of need for a guy that can\xe2\x80\x99t hit. The only young hope the Orioles have is Manny Machado and Dylan Bundy, both should take time to develop.To me Jordan is a MAIN reason why the Orioles are what they are today. When we had a decent lineup or pitching staff we could never have the pleasure of bringing decent talent up from the minor leagues. He could not draft in the 1st round and definitely not any round after. The saying goes \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make the same mistake twice\xe2\x80\x9d, well Joe Jordan may just have been given the gift of drafting 2 Tim Lincecums, and passed on them both.Good Luck in Philly Joe, we won\xe2\x80\x99t Miss You!*- Team player got drafted byFollow on Twitter: @BK_Havinitmyway ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

The only science that fits my appetite is astronomy, so no worries there. However we all know what a foreshock\xc2\xa0is I presume; a small earthquake that\xe2\x80\x99s in essence a precursor to a larger-scale one (the opposite of an aftershock). My question is whether or not this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s Oriole games give us a foreshock\xc2\xa0or preview of sorts of what we\xe2\x80\x99ll see next weekend when the season begins. Originally the plan was for Jake Arrieta to start yesterday against the Twins, yet he was pushed back a day to this afternoon against the Pirates. Is Buck Showalter trying to give his presumed Opening Day starter an extra day of rest and at the same time line him up to pitch next Friday?\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6survey says: no idea folks. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s Opening Day starter and his decisions about the rotation in general has been a closely guarded state secret. He hinted this week that he knew what he was going to do for the most part, however there are still some details to iron out. Some of my brethren in the writing field are starting to get a bit frustrated with the whole thing about who\xe2\x80\x99s on the starting rotation and who\xe2\x80\x99s not. Quite honestly, I have no problem with it. It\xe2\x80\x99s certainly worth telling the people involved that they\xe2\x80\x99re going to be in the rotation and so forth so they can prepare, but why give the opposing team (Minnesota in this case) the chance to know who they\xe2\x80\x99ll be facing?That aside, my prediction for the rotation remains the same: Arrieta, Hunter, Hammels, Matusz, and Chen (and in that order, but perhaps with Matusz and Chen being interchangeable). That would mean that Arrieta will be starting next Friday afternoon on Opening Day at the yard. So it does in fact stand to reason that Showalter moved him back a day so as to give him some extra rest, however also to ensure that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t end up with a full seven days between starts. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be interested to see how deep into today\xe2\x80\x99s game Arrieta goes, as I suspect that Showalter already knows and perhaps has even told Jake that he\xe2\x80\x99ll be the Opening Day starter.Tommy Hunter was also pushed back to tomorrow afternoon against Tampa, and if my calculations are correct that would make him the starting pitcher Saturday night at the yard against the Twins. Again, I (along with everyone else) can only speculate because nothing\xe2\x80\x99s been announced. As I said yesterday, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be shocked to see Arrieta and perhaps Hunter skip the last two exhibition games in Sarasota and Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game in Norfolk so that they can come north ahead of the team to get settled in. The only caveat there would be that if they stayed with the team they could in theory throw their normal bullpen sessions that pitchers throw between starts, however that remains to be seen.The other question I have is about left field. My personal opinion is that Nolan Reimold is going to be the everyday left fielder, however Endy Chavez has looked pretty good in camp. Honestly, I\xe2\x80\x99d hate to see a \xe2\x80\x9cyoung\xe2\x80\x9d guy like Reimold get passed up because a veteran might have played just a little better. I\xe2\x80\x99d prefer that the Orioles go with youth that has staying power with the team in the future. They need to find out if Reimold plays a role in that future. Having said that, Chavez is playing center field this afternoon in Bradenton against Pittsburgh. Part of the reason that Duquette wanted Chavez was to give Adam Jones a day off here and there. Ultimately more than anything else, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to be watching the pitchers in these last two Grapefruit League games to hopefully get a glimpse of what Oriole fans are to expect this coming season.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadalaUpdate: I guess the premise of this column is almost pointless in a sense, because the Birds changed tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s starter to Wei-Yin Chen.

Time does fly, in this case seemingly faster than an Adam Jones line drive or a Jake Arrieta heater. The stadium that changed the way stadiums are built was an instant classic. Now, it\'s simply the grande dame of the post-modern era of sports architecture, but its continuing impact on both baseball and Baltimore cannot be overestimated. ""Building Camden Yards was one of the most important things that happened to baseball in the last 20 to 25 years,"" Major League Baseball commissioner Allan H. ""Bud"" Selig said. ""It changed the whole dynamic. It led to all these wonderful stadiums and allowed us to finally market our sport to its potential -- particularly the last five years of terrific growth. var adSkipCounter = 0;  ""It set it all off. It never would have happened without Camden Yards. But I don\'t think anybody could really have understood how dramatically it was going to change the face of baseball and the Orioles."" It also changed the cityscape of Baltimore -- vastly broadening the appeal of the Inner Harbor area -- and was the giant first step in the development of a multisport complex that is among the most admired in the world. The only thing that has changed over the past two decades is the context in which it is viewed both inside and outside the Baltimore area. There were those who suspected at the time that it would shake the American sports landscape, but for the diverse cast of characters who planned and designed Oriole Park, the mission was to assure that the Orioles remained in Baltimore and the stadium became a unique, organic component of the rejuvenation of the downtown area. ""We did envision a traditional, old-fashioned ballpark with modern amenities,"" said former Orioles president and CEO Larry Lucchino, who first proposed the concept of a ballpark that took baseball into the past and the future at the same time. ""What we didn\'t know was that it would light a fire in the industry and cause other cities to seek similar ballparks, but that\'s exactly what it did do."" The impact on baseball architecture was almost immediate, and the impact on baseball economics would be dramatic. Baseball author and political commentator George Will once called Oriole Park one of the three most important developments in baseball in the postwar era, along with Jackie Robinson\'s breaking the game\'s color barrier and the advent of free agency. Nothing that has happened over the past 20 years has caused him to change that opinion. ""It taught baseball to look backward,"" Will said. ""We conservatives are always being told that you can\'t turn the clock back. Baseball did. ""We\'d gone through the ghastly \'60s and \'70s period with those stadiums built for both baseball and football that were good for neither. You didn\'t know if you were in Pittsburgh, St. Louis or Philadelphia. You couldn\'t tell the difference."" There is plenty of credit to go around for what remains one of the architectural jewels of professional sports -- from architect Joe Spear and the large staff at HOK Sport (now known as Populace) to Orioles architectural consultant Janet Marie Smith to Maryland Stadium Authority chief Herb Belgrad and beyond. Even current Orioles owner Peter Angelos, who arrived on the scene after the ballpark opened, deserves some for heavily promoting ""Camden-ization"" as the answer to Major League Baseball\'s economic ills. But clearly, the two biggest players in the drive to re-establish Baltimore as a major sports town and enhance the appeal of the Inner Harbor as a tourist destination were late mayor and Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer and -- ironically -- the current president of the Boston Red Sox. ""I\'ve said this over and over,"" Lucchino said. ""I had one original idea in my whole baseball career. It was to build a traditional ballpark for the Baltimore Orioles with modern amenities and conveniences so we could have the revenue to compete with the best teams in baseball."" Why there? Why then? The architectural considerations aside, it is widely accepted that Camden Yards was truly conceived March 29, 1984, when Baltimore sports fans woke up to the staggering realization that their beloved Colts had skipped town in the middle of the night. The Orioles, then owned by Washington attorney Edward Bennett Williams, were itching to move to a location that would be more accessible to fans in the D.C. area. Schaefer, clearly shaken by the departure of the Colts, initially pondered a major renovation of Memorial Stadium but soon shifted focus to building a multipurpose stadium closer to downtown that would satisfy the Orioles and help the city acquire an NFL expansion franchise.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Tillman will open the season as a starter at Norfolk.""He\'s made strides,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""Tillman\'s maturity level and everything else, he\'s so close to putting it together. There\'s a reason why he stayed here as long as he did. He\'s made a lot of strides. I like where he is.

That included three outings of three innings or more.As camp winded down, and the Orioles\' starting rotation became clearer, it became obvious that Tillman\'s only way of making the team would be as a long reliever. But the organization felt he would be better off in a regular starting role in Triple-A.""He needs the ball in his hand,"" Showalter said. ""He\'s got some things he needs to finish off, and he knows it. He\'s shown flashes of really being a force. I\'d be disappointed if he doesn\'t have a good year, if he doesn\'t start well down there.""""I\'m here to help this team anyway I can,"" Tillman said Saturday before he was optioned. ""I went into the offseason with that mentality and I wanted to get better. Last year, I was inconsistent; it was like one good game, one bad game all year. I want these guys to be able to trust me any time I get out there. Either way I can do it, I\'m more than happy doing it.""The move leaves 15 pitchers vying for 12 spots on the Orioles\' Opening Day roster. It also means the team\'s No. 5 starter will either be lefty Brian Matusz or lefty Tsuyoshi Wada.This is Tillman\'s final minor-league option.Neshek impressing O\'sRight-hander Pat Neshek, a non-roster invitee who hasn\'t allowed as run in nine relief innings this spring, said he finally feels healthy again after having Tommy John surgery in 2008.This spring, he\'s shown he\'s regained his velocity, his control and his confidence.""I feel a lot better than last year,"" Neshek said Saturday, a day after making his first back-to-back appearance of the spring, a perfect 2/3 of an inning against the Tigers. ""I kind of feel where I was before the surgery. Last year, there were flashes of 88-89 [mph], in maybe a real good game 90. That was very few. This year it seems I\'m doing it at ease, like I\'m hitting 88 without putting much into it, and that\'s the pretty cool thing about it, because last year I was probably about 85-86.""It will still be difficult for Neshek to make the Orioles\' 25-man roster out of camp, because he\'s signed to a minor-league deal and can easily be sent to Triple-A Norfolk. Plus, the team would need to allocate a 40-man roster spot for him. But the 31-year-old said he\'s fine with starting the season in the minors.""The biggest thing is just feeling good and knowing that I think I will be successful,"" Neshek said. ""That\'s really all that matters. It would be nice [to make the team], but if not now, then in a month or two. You really want to look at the end goal.""With the Padres last season, Neshek, who owns one of the more unconventional sidearm deliveries in baseball, struggled with his control \xe2\x80\x94 which was one of his strengths during his seasons as the Twins\' setup man. But this spring he has seven strikeouts and no walks.""I think I\'m there,"" he said. ""I\'m really happy. It\'s only taken three years. I was talking to Luis Ayala and he had Tommy John and he said it took him four years. After last year, you start saying, Man, I\'m putting everything into this and I\'m not getting anywhere. You want to keep going but it\'s tough, I don\'t know what happened this offseason.""Said Showalter: ""The pure velocity is not all the way back, but it\'s better than it was last year.

04/01/2012,"[('Orioles Sign Johnny Damon to Two-Year Deal - Camden Chat', ' Editor\'s Note: The rumors turn out to be true. WTF!? The story is behind a paywall, so I have excerpted most of it below... *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   *   * When Dan Duquette took over as GM of the Baltimore Orioles in November, observers around baseball wondered just how long it would be before he turned to some of ""his guys"": the unorthodox players he brought to Boston ten years ago, who went on to break that team\'s 86-year World Series losing streak. The answer appears to be: ""not very long."" With Brian Roberts again starting the season on the disabled list, and no foolproof choice to resolve the team\'s leadoff hitting woes, Duquette inked free agent outfielder Johnny Damon to a two-year deal, it was announced yesterday. Damon, a client of Scott Boras, had been unemployed for the entire offseason. The story was first tweeted by Jon Heyman.    The deal is for $10M, with another $500,000 possible via incentives, and a club option for 2014. Damon made $5.25M last season with the Tampa Bay Rays.    To make room on the roster, the Orioles designated outfielder Nolan Reimold for assignment. The inconsistent left fielder was out of options, and had batted just .087 in his leadoff appearances during spring training. One club official said the Orioles had grown weary of his ""foolhardy"" approach to the game. Reunited for the first time since April 2002, Damon and Duquette were all smiles at the introductory press conference.    ""It feels great,"" said Damon. ""I\'m relieved to have found a team that could use me. I\'m just happy to be here\xe2\x80\x94hope I can help the ballclub. I just want to give it my best shot, and the good Lord willing, things will work out."" Damon will wear #22, since his preferred #18 is currently worn by pitcher Tsuyoshi Wada. ""We got the guy we wanted all along. A guy who\'s averaged 75 RBIs every year of his career and can score runs. Mr. Angelos fully supported this move,"" said Duquette. ""We\'d be foolish not to sign him."" ""Throughout Spring Training, we were looking for someone to take over the leadoff role,"" said Orioles manager Buck Showalter, ""but each time we thought we had an answer, it turned out we had fool\'s gold. Johnny\'s a premiere leadoff hitter, and he\'ll bring a veteran presence to the clubhouse. Plus he was in that \'Bunch of Fools,\' or whatever those guys called themselves over there in \'04."" (Showalter was presumably referring to the \'Bunch of Idiots\' moniker coined by Damon.) Asked where Damon would play, Showalter replied he would start in left field, and occasionally rotate into the DH spot to give relief to new Orioles Wilson Betemit and Nick Johnson. ""I\'m glad we got it done,"" he said. ""Tomorrow\'s the first day of April, we open in five days, and we needed to stop fooling around."" Source: Chicago Sentinel   ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Spring Training Game Omega: Rays @ Orioles, 1:05pm ...', "" We come, at last, to the conclusion of this seemingly-interminable spring training season. We've been wanting real baseball all winter, and spring training only does so much to whet the appetite. This is the last of the fake games - or at least, it's the last of the fake games where both teams are making a token effort to play real major league players. The Orioles, in fact, have three more tune-up games remaining, one each Monday and Tuesday against a different Florida college team and one against the Norfolk Tides on Wednesday.Still, today's game, televised on MASN and on the radio as well, is the final game of the Grapefruit League. It's the last chance that anyone who's auditioning for a spot will have to impress against major league competition - though really, one might rather hope the O's aren't going to judge off a one-game sample anyway. All that's left to settle is the composition of the bullpen, and likely the order of the rotation. Buck Showalter has yet to name an Opening Day starter, or any starter, as far as I can tell. Today's starter Wei-Yin Chen would seem to be a lock for somewhere in the rotation. Playing for the Orioles: Chavez (LF), Hardy, Markakis, Jones, Wieters, Johnson (DH), Reynolds, Davis, Andino That is a lineup we could see on Opening Day, though I hope Nolan Reimold gets the start instead of Chavez. I have learned to be ready for disappointment when it comes to Reimold playing time. The Rays are playing some guys: Jennings (CF), Pena (1B), Longoria (3B), Keppinger (DH), Rodriguez (SS), Molina (C), Joyce (LF), Johnson (RF), Brignac (2B), with James Shields pitching. I think that is something resembling an actual MLB lineup as well.    In spring training, the O's have won some games, lost some games, tied some games. In two weeks none of that will matter. We fans will either be in the throes of elation due to unexpected success, despair due to wholly anticipated catastrophic failure, or perhaps in the middle, our minds not quite made up yet.

Each time we\xe2\x80\x99d hear some of the same things, starting with you have to play 27 outs and so forth.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Red Sox get really caught up in \xe2\x80\x9cmoments,\xe2\x80\x9d and go figure so many of them over time came against the Orioles. That Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day Massacre in 2007 is just one example; how many other times would Boston find some way to come through against the O\xe2\x80\x99s and leave the Oriole players as witnesses to their wild celebrations? The worst part was that it often felt like they enjoyed beating up on the Orioles. Again, when this is happening at Camden Yards to the delight of Red Sox fans in attendance, that\xe2\x80\x99s a tough pill to swallow.\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6this Oriole team found out something about itself over the last few weeks, capped off by a five-to-ten minute sequence of events last night which drove a spear deep into the heart of moxieland. William Shakespeare and Andrew Lloyd Webber couldn\xe2\x80\x99t combine to write a better opera than what we saw last night. The O\xe2\x80\x99s and BoSox ended up with an hour-and-a-half rain delay with Boston up 3-2 in the middle of the 7th, while Tampa was stumbling along trailing their game 7-0 to NY. By the time the rain delay ended, that lead had evaporated to one run (7-6). The O\xe2\x80\x99s threatened in the last of the 7th, only to leave two runners on base. However perhaps more importantly as Dan Johnson tied the Tampa game at seven with a homer in the last of the ninth, Carl Crawford hit a double to the gap in left center. As Marco Scutaro rounded third to go home we saw a familiar sight. Adam Jones relayed the ball into J.J. Hardy, who combined with Matt Wieters to nail Scutaro at the plate.\xe2\x80\x9dSuddenly it seemed that for once the shoe might be changing to the other foot. As we all remember, that one game was everything for the Red Sox, and it was just the season finale for an Oriole team that had come in under expectations all season long. However for that one shining moment, they didn\xe2\x80\x99t stink. They had an opportunity to stick it right back to Boston when it truly counted, and to do the Red Sox the same way that the Red Sox had done them so many times in the past.\xe2\x80\x9cThat brought Robert Andino and Evan Longoria to the plate at almost simultaneous moments in time. Andino hit a line drive towards Carl Crawford in left field\xe2\x80\xa6as the ball hung in the air the fortunes of potentially several different franchises, players, and coaches seemed to hang in the balance juxtaposed together all at one moment in time. Crawford came on strong for the ball; however he failed to dive to catch it, prompting the ball to slide under his glove. At almost the same moment Nolan Reimold crossed home plate to win the game for the fighting Showalters, Evan Longoria hit a walk-off homer in Tampa.\xe2\x80\x9dIn my mind the story was how it all came together at almost the same moment with Andino\xe2\x80\x99s walk off double and Longoria\xe2\x80\x99s homer. Many people said that the ensuing celebration was over-the-top on the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 part. Keep in mind that Boston has never been shy about celebrating, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve done it at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 expense on numerous occasions. Former Oriole Luke Scott called it the greatest night of baseball in history. I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of opinion, however it was without a doubt the greatest closing act I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen. Good opera always leaves us asking for more, does it not?\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6at the beginning I said that 2011 would be a season to remember in Birdland. To the final day of the season, it had almost become an afterthought. Losing season number 14 (in a row), right? Perhaps, however at the end the 2011 Baltimore Orioles left their mark in baseball history. In doing so, they proved Stevie Wonder\xe2\x80\x99s point. In the last hour of the last day, before their life was done, they found their place in the sun.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles need to move on from this moment. Rest assured that the fans will never let them forget it,\xc2\xa0but that moment in itself has no affect on 2012. However the O\xe2\x80\x99s do need to take the very spirit of that moment and everything that it meant for the\xc2\xa0franchise and the fans,\xc2\xa0and bring it onward. If they\xe2\x80\x99re able to do that, there\xe2\x80\x99ll be some good summer days at the yard in 2012.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles Opening Day Expected To Be A Big Hit \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' BALTIMORE\xc2\xa0(WJZ/BALTIMORE ORIOLES) \xe2\x80\x94 This coming Friday will be Opening Day for Orioles baseball. The team will face the Minnesota Twins on Friday, April 6, at 3:05 p.m., 20 years to the day that Camden Yards hosted its first regular season game in 1992. The team just released some of its special plans for that day. To allow fans the opportunity to experience the excitement of Opening Day, the entire ballpark will open at noon on Friday. Each fan will receive a 2012 schedule and car magnet at the gates. Roving musical groups will entertain fans on Eutaw Street and the main concourses. Fans are encouraged to be in their seats by 2:30 p.m., when pre-game ceremonies will begin. MASN personality Jim Hunter will serve as emcee for the pre-game festivities. In a continuation of the Opening Day tradition, Orioles players and coaches will be introduced prior to the game. Orioles players will run through the center field gate on an orange carpet and take their places between first and second base. Manager Buck Showalter, coaches and staff will be introduced from the Orioles dugout. Members of the Twins will be announced and will run from their dugout to line up between second and third base. In a pairing of 1992 Opening Day batterymates, former Orioles pitcher Rick Sutcliffe will throw out the ceremonial first pitch to Orioles Hall of Fame catcher Chris Hoiles. Sutcliffe was the first pitcher to take the mound at Camden Yards in 1992, throwing a five-hit shutout in a 2-0 Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 win over the Cleveland Indians. For the 19th straight season, one fan will be chosen to represent all Orioles fans as the team\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9c10th man\xe2\x80\x9d. The fan will be introduced as a part of the Orioles starting lineup during the pre-game ceremonies. OriolesREACH has arranged for 80 youth from local Girl Scout troops to line the orange carpet holding Orioles flags during player introductions. The Girl Scouts are celebrating their 100th anniversary in 2012. Representing The Modell\xc2\xa0Performing Arts Center at the Lyric, tenor Rolando Sanz\xc2\xa0will perform the National Anthem and God Bless America. Sanz\xc2\xa0recently made his Carnegie Hall debut singing the role of Kostik\xc2\xa0in the world premiere of Prokofiev\xe2\x80\x99s lost opera Dal\xc3\xabkie\xc2\xa0Morja (Distant Seas). During the anthem, a 30\xe2\x80\x99x 42\xe2\x80\x99 American flag from Fort McHenry will be unfurled over the batter\xe2\x80\x99s eye wall in center field. The flag is a replica of the one that flew over Fort McHenry when Francis Scott Key wrote the National Anthem. Colors will be presented by the Fort McHenry Guard in celebration of the bicentennial of the War of 1812. The group consists of men and women, National Park Service personnel and volunteers, who represent the defenders of Baltimore and Fort McHenry: the Field Music in scarlet and white; the Corps of Artillery, the Baltimore Fencibles, the Sea Fencibles, and the citizens of Baltimore who supported them. Rawlings established the Rawlings Gold Glove Award in 1957 to recognize the best fielders at each position; it has evolved into baseball\xe2\x80\x99s greatest measure of defensive excellence. Every year, managers and coaches of each Major League Baseball team select a squad of the best defensemen in their respective leagues, excluding their own teams. In 2011, right fielder Nick Markakis\xc2\xa0and catcher Matt Wieters\xc2\xa0were named Gold Glove Award winners at their respective positions. Both were first-time recipients.

Again, this comes as no surprise to most people that follow the team, however now it\xe2\x80\x99s out there and official. This completes quick a comeback for Arrieta, who last season went 10-8 with an ERA of 5.05 over 22 starts. His season was cut short due to bone spurs in his right (throwing) elbow. Manager Buck Showalter also said that he felt that Arrieta was one of the team\xe2\x80\x99s better pitchers last season before the surgery.\xc2\xa0Last season you might remember that Arrieta began the season as the fourth starter in the rotation, however I think that was a specific rotation spot that was given to him for almost the same reason that he\xe2\x80\x99s the Opening Day starter in 2012. Game four of 2011 was the home opener at Camden Yards, and I think that Buck Showalter wanted to showcase Arrieta for the hometown fans. He certainly brings a certain amount of swagger to the mound in his starts, which rarely leave anyone asking for more cowbell please! At this point Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s statistics in the Grapefruit League are all but irrelevant, however for the record he was 1-0 with an ERA of 6.14. That ERA isn\xe2\x80\x99t exactly the greatest, but again keep in mind that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about limited and almost controled appearances in spring training as opposed to pitching in regular season games. One of Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s vices has always been walks, and the good news is that in 14 and 2/3\xe2\x80\x99s of an inning he only walked one batter.Arrieta will be taxed with trying to go deep into a game on Friday to avoid having to tap too far into a bullpen that appears to be a bit improved but is still potentially a huge question mark. Showalter also pulled back the curtain on some of the other starters, but not in total. Jason Hammel will get the start on Easter Sunday at the yard against the Twins, and it sounds as if Wei-Yin Chen has earned a rotation spot as well. Showalter didn\xe2\x80\x99t say whether Chen would be the second or fourth starter, and he neglected to actually name a fifth starter. (Keep in mind that the decision might have already been made and the guy\xe2\x80\x99s beginning to prepare, however the public hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been told yet.) So the rotation will look something like this: Arrieta, [possibly] Chen/Hunter, Hammel, [possibly] Chen/Hunter, and a fifth starter. I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that other starter will Brian Matusz; if so, I would expect Chen to be the #2 starter, Hunter the #4, and Matusz the #5. As staff writer Randy Buchman correctly pointed out to me, odds are against them throwing two southpaws (Chen and Matusz) back-to-back.Radio Appearance: So get this\xe2\x80\xa6your humble correspondent (that being me) will be appearing as a guest on behalf of Birds Watcher and the Fansided network on \xe2\x80\x9cSuper Sports 101.7-FM\xe2\x80\x9d in Blacksburg, VA at 4:30 this afternoon to talk Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 baseball on The Clubhouse with Kyle Bailey.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Jake Arrieta walked to the mound with one purpose: to let everyone know the Baltimore Orioles aren't as bad as advertised.Arrieta pitched seven scoreless innings, Nick Markakis homered and drove in three runs, and the Orioles marked the 20th anniversary of the opening of Camden Yards by defeating the Minnesota Twins 4-2 Friday.Baltimore has suffered through 14 straight losing seasons and is the popular choice to finish in the cellar of the AL East. On this day, however, the Orioles and Arrieta outshined Minnesota and veteran pitcher Carl Pavano.''My mindset was to just really set the tone for our team in front of a great crowd,'' Arrieta said. ''There were a lot of excited fans for a new season, so it was important to come out and set the tone the way we did. As a whole, we take it personal that most people write us off from the get-go. We made a statement today: We've got a lot to play for this year.''Making his first opening day start, Arrieta (1-0) allowed two hits, struck out four and walked two in a 97-pitch performance reminiscent of the gem that Rick Sutcliffe tossed against the Cleveland Indians in the ballpark's first opener.Sutcliffe, who threw out the ceremonial first pitch Friday, christened Camden Yards by pitching a five-hit shutout on April 6, 1992.The only two hits against Arrieta came in the fourth. The right-hander didn't make it the distance, but that didn't detract from what he accomplished in his first start since elbow surgery ended his season last August.''I wanted to be ready for this day,'' Arrieta said. ''And being able to be on the mound today at 100 percent makes it all worth it.''Baltimore newcomer Matt Lindstrom gave up two hits in the eighth and Troy Patton yielded a two-run homer to Josh Willingham in the ninth. Jim Johnson then got two outs - the last one with runners on the corners - for the save.Markakis hit a two-run homer in the first inning and added an RBI triple in the sixth. He also walked and scored twice, but he acknowledged that the key player in the win was Arrieta.''When you have a guy like Jake on the mound and he throws the way he did today, just score some runs for him,'' Markakis said. ''He set the tone. It starts with pitching.''Pavano (0-1) allowed four runs and five hits over seven innings in his third career opening day start. He issued two walks, and both were costly.''It is not the way you wanted to start the season, not individually or as a team,'' Pavano said. ''You have to tip your hats to them - they took advantage of what was given them. I walked two guys and they both scored.''Minnesota opened last season with a 13-3 loss to Toronto and ended up finishing in last place. Pavano took the loss in that one, too.This game, at least, was much closer.''We made a run at them. We gave ourselves a shot,'' manager Ron Gardenhire said. ''Willy hit the big home run and we found ourselves out there in another situation where with another big hit, who knows what happens?''Although the Orioles have fallen upon hard times since Camden Yards opened, the folksy, old-fashioned ballpark that stands in the shadow of the B&O Warehouse has undergone only a few cosmetic changes over the past 20 years.Camden Yards used to attract a sellout crowd for every game. That is no longer the case, but on this day 46,773 fans packed the stadium under a clear sky on a chilly afternoon.Soon after Sutcliffe casually tossed a strike on the outside corner to former battery mate Chris Hoiles, Arrieta began the Orioles' season with a first-pitch strike to Denard Span.The Twins didn't get their first hit until Span beat out a grounder leading off the fourth. Justin Morneau then singled with two outs before Willingham lined out to left.Markakis put Baltimore up 2-0 in the first with an opposite-field drive to left after J.J. Hardy drew a one-out walk. Pavano retired the next eight batters before Markakis drew a leadoff walk in the fourth. Adam Jones followed with a double and Matt Wieters hit a run-scoring grounder for a 3-0 lead.In the sixth, Hardy led off with a single and Markakis hit a liner to right that Ryan Doumit failed to grab near the wall while looking into the sun.NOTES: Markakis is the first Oriole to homer in his initial at-bat on opening day since Luis Matos in 2005. ... It was the third straight year the Twins opened the season on the road. ... Willingham played in his 800th career game. ... In his only start against the Twins last year, Arrieta threw six shutout innings. ... Baltimore is 13-4 at Camden Yards on opening day. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

The Columbia resident held a standing-room-only ticket, and his plan all along was to secure one of the precious stools that offer a fresh, stunning view of the 20-year-old park. He brought to his perch a bag of Doritos, a bottle of Dr Pepper and an absolute determination to hold his seat, which appeared to be coveted by hundreds of other patrons. ""It\'s amazing,"" Hudak said of the rooftop bar and lounge, which was a hit on Opening Day. ""This is better than a good number of seats around the park."" var adSkipCounter = 0;  The Orioles opened their season with a 4-2 victory over the Minnesota Twins before a sellout crowd of 46,773. But after enduring 14 straight losing seasons, many fans said they come out more for the splendor of Camden Yards than for the team that has disappointed them for too long. The new amenities \xe2\x80\x94 which include the rooftop deck, a redesigned flag court with clearer views behind the right-field scoreboard and a sprawling brewpub named after former catcher Rick Dempsey \xe2\x80\x94 only enhanced the feeling that Camden Yards is the star of this town\'s baseball show. ""That\'s why I come,"" said Hudak. ""I still root for the team, but if it wasn\'t for the park, I wouldn\'t be out here as much."" The Orioles understand this as well as anyone. They have built their marketing campaign for 2012 around the 20th anniversary of a park that revolutionized American baseball architecture. From the banners hanging over downtown streets to the commercials on local television, the ballpark and its history are front and center, far more than any individual player. ""I don\'t think you can overstate how important the park is,"" said club spokesman Greg Bader. ""We certainly need to improve on the field. That should be the expectation of fans. But we hope no one is depriving themselves of the opportunity to come out to the park."" Bader called this year\'s additions to Camden Yards \xe2\x80\x94 funded by the Orioles, the Maryland Stadium Authority and concessionaire Delaware North \xe2\x80\x94 ""by far the most visible"" in the park\'s history. ""They\'re the types of changes that will impact all the fans coming to the game,"" he said. Orioles manager Buck Showalter said the efforts to keep Camden Yards on the cutting edge are not lost on him or his players. ""The ballpark is a cathedral,"" he said before Friday\'s opener. ""Can you imagine anybody every saying we need a new ballpark or where are we going to put a new park?"" Reminders of the park\'s history were everywhere, with a broadcast of the first Opening Day at Camden Yards blaring on the video board during batting practice and Rick Sutcliffe, who started that game for the Orioles, tossing out Friday\'s ceremonial first pitch. David Winyall of Columbia said he spent the first Opening Day at Camden Yards standing outside the gate, begging for a ticket. No one would sell him one, even though the game fell on his birthday. Winyall made it inside this year, enjoying batting practice from the revamped flag court along Eutaw Street. The club lowered the right-field scoreboard by four feet and replaced a stone wall that blocked shorter fans\' views with waist-level iron railings. ""It favors short people so we\'re against it,"" joked the 6-foot-4 Winyall. ""No, it\'s great. You\'re right up on the field."" While admitting he\'s no fan of embattled Orioles owner Peter Angelos, Winyall said, ""at least he makes the Maryland Stadium Authority take care of the park."" The roof deck in center drew even more raves. The space features a rectangular open-air bar with flat-screen televisions, orange couches shaded by umbrellas and stools that offer a panoramic view of the field. ""We have seats, but I think we might just stay up here,"" said Jen Myers of Pasadena. ""The view is breathtaking."" The deck was open on a first-come, first-serve basis Friday, and fans jammed the space shortly after the gates opened. But Bader said the club would keep open the possibility of selling tickets for the deck later in the season. ""It\'s beautiful up here,"" said Mike Andrus of Bel Air, who brought his wife and two sons to Opening Day. ""It\'s really comfortable and casual, just a great place to hang out."" Andrus expects another tough year for the Orioles. His sons, 14 and 11, have never even seen a winning season. ""I don\'t want to be a grandfather before it happens,"" Andrus said. But no matter what, he said, the splendor of Camden Yards keeps his family coming out a few times a year. ""That\'s the attraction,"" said Andrus, wearing an Orioles-themed Hawaiian shirt. ""If the stadium wasn\'t this nice,"" said his wife, Allison, ""we probably wouldn\'t care at all."" Brett White of White Marsh mustered a little more optimism about his favorite team. The 97-mph fastballs of Opening Day starter Jake Arrieta and the Gold Glove of catcher Matt Wieters had him dreaming of a winning record. But that was just conjecture. The roof deck was real-life ""awesome."" ""It should be the team that gets people out here,"" White said. ""But right now, it\'s probably more people loving the park. I take it for granted, but every time we come, we want to come back because of the park. I think that\'s why everybody always comes back."" childs.walker@baltsun.com     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

04/08/2012,"[('Hammel leads Orioles to 3-1 win over Twins - yahoo.com', ""View photosMinnesota Twins starter Anthony Swarzak follows through on a pitch to the Baltimore Orioles in the second inning of a baseball game in Baltimore, Sunday, April 8, 2012. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Jason Hammel was peeling off his Baltimore Orioles uniform after the finest pitching performance of his career, wearing a grin that displayed not one hint of disappointment about missing a chance to make baseball history.Teammate Matt Lindstrom walked over to the right-hander, patted him on the shoulder and said one word: ''Awesome.''Seconds later, Troy Patton emerged from the shower, looked at Hammel and applauded.Hammel took a no-hitter into the eighth inning in his Baltimore debut, and although he didn't go the distance, his effort Sunday helped the Orioles beat the Minnesota Twins 3-1 for a three-game sweep.Hammel (1-0) faced the minimum 21 batters through seven innings, allowing two walks, before Justin Morneau ended the no-hit bid with a leadoff double off the right-field wall in the eighth.''It wasn't actually that bad of a pitch,'' Hammel said. ''Obviously, Morneau is a great hitter. It was a changeup that was up just a little bit. Oh well.''The crowd of 14,738 stood in appreciation of Hammel's performance.''It was a pleasure to do that for the fans, the first time they've seen me,'' he said. ''They sure knew what was going on and they backed me up pretty good.''The no-hitter was gone, but Hammel still had a 3-0 lead to protect.Josh Willingham followed with an RBI double and Sean Burroughs drew a one-out walk before Hammel finished by striking out Luke Hughes and retiring Ben Revere on a fly to right.Jim Johnson worked a perfect ninth to earn his second save and complete the two-hitter.Hammel came to Baltimore in February with Lindstrom in a trade that sent Jeremy Guthrie to Colorado. Hammel allowed three walks and struck out five over eight memorable innings.Asked if it was the best he's ever thrown, the 6-foot-6 Hammel replied: ''For sure. I haven't been much better than that.''Quite simply, he had no-hit stuff.''I think he had a real good chance because he was real efficient from a pitch count standpoint,'' Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair said. ''The type of groundballs he was getting, they were kind of chopped. I thought he had a chance. I was nervous for him. It was fun to watch.''Hammel didn't get the no-hitter, but did not seem to mind.''Not at all. There's no disappointment there,'' he said. ''It's one crack at it. I feel like I'm going to be around the game for long. I'm sure I'll have more chances at it.''After beating Tampa Bay in three straight games on the road last year, the Orioles have opened the season with two straight three-game sweeps for the first time since 1996-97 - both of which turned out to be playoff seasons.J.J. Hardy homered for the Orioles, who have won seven straight over the Twins by a collective score of 39-9. The streak began with a four-game sweep last August in Minnesota.The Twins scored only five runs in this series, none of them over the first seven innings. The only other times Minnesota started 0-3 were in 1969 and 1981.''We're going to keep grinding,'' said Ryan Doumit, who went hitless in the series. ''We have some pretty good baseball players on this team. We're going to be fine.''Twins starter Anthony Swarzak (0-1) performed admirably in place of Liam Hendriks, who was hospitalized over the weekend with apparent food poisoning. Swarzak, who's normally used as a long reliever, gave up one run and four hits in five innings. The lone glaring flaw was Hardy's first-inning homer.''Swarzak threw the ball great today,'' Morneau said. ''We haven't done a whole lot early in the games. They've thrown the ball well. Their hitters managed to get it done and we didn't.''Swarzak was replaced by Matt Maloney, who allowed two runs in the sixth. Adam Jones hit a leadoff single, Nick Johnson was hit by a pitch with one out and both moved up on a double steal before Wilson Betemit doubled in two runs for a 3-0 lead.That proved to be enough offense to back Hammel, who was extremely sharp leading up to the eighth.The only runner against Hammel over the first four innings was Willingham, who walked in the second before Doumit hit into a double play.Morneau drew a leadoff walk in the fifth, but Willingham promptly bounced into a 1-4-3 double play. Baltimore put runners at the corners with two outs in the bottom half before Nick Markakis flied out to right.Hammel kept the no-hitter intact in the sixth, getting three straight routine groundouts. The same thing happened in the seventh.NOTES: Orioles LHP Wei-Yin Chen makes his major league debut Monday night against the New York Yankees. ... The Twins will send Nick Blackburn to the mound Monday in their home opener against the Los Angeles Angels. ... Hardy's homer was his first RBI of the season.

Yet, as the Yankees will discover during their three-game series against the Orioles that started Monday night, the stadium has undergone a modest face-lift that is partly a response to what newer ballparks have done since 1992.Two decades after its opening \xe2\x80\x94 with Cal Ripken in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup and Rick Sutcliffe the starting pitcher \xe2\x80\x94 Camden Yards is still the architectural gem that inspired the designs of nearly every major league stadium built since. Its brick exterior, downtown location, asymmetrical dimensions and old B&O warehouse as a unique backdrop and distant outfield boundary would feel new if they were not so familiar.Not surprisingly, Camden Yards, which was designed by Populous, is being marketed as the \xe2\x80\x9cballpark that forever changed baseball.\xe2\x80\x9d There is no argument on that claim. The proof is out there at newer stadiums like PNC, AT&T and Citizens Bank Parks and in Citi, Target and Coors Fields.But 20 years is a generation. Camden Yards was a template for other teams to try to improve on.Most newer stadiums are smaller and cozier and have concourses that allow fans to watch the action as they buy food or beverages. Other stadiums are effectively theme parks where baseball sometimes seems like a secondary concern. And some look out to better skylines.

Most starters depart the ballpark by the ninth inning of spring training games, so the first opportunity for a victorious postgame procession needed to come in the regular season. The Yankees waited three games longer than they hoped, but on Monday they finally secured a 6-2 victory.\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of times, the first for everything is the most difficult to get in a season,\xe2\x80\x9d Derek Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWhether it\xe2\x80\x99s the first hit, first R.B.I., first anything \xe2\x80\x94 first win.\xe2\x80\x9dThe only indication that this was not a typical night at the ballpark for a Yankees-Orioles game was the standings. The Yankees entered Camden Yards with a 0-3 record, and the Orioles welcomed their counterparts with a 3-0 record. A loss might have prompted further unrest among the Yankee fan base, which tends not to accept last place at any point in the season.A contingent of Yankee fans filled the stands in Baltimore, and they had ample reason to applaud early, when Teixeira\xe2\x80\x99s run-scoring single in the first gave the Yankees a 1-0 lead. Jeter, who was a member of the last Yankees team to open the season 0-3 in 1998, helped with a four-hit game highlighted by a run-scoring double to cap a three-run fourth. Every player in the batting order except for Alex Rodriguez and Nick Swisher had a hit.

Andruw Jones, who was starting in place of Brett Gardner for the second time in three games, hit a solo home run in the sixth. Eduardo Nunez, who committed the only Yankee error of the season, made a diving catch at third base to end the fourth inning. And Ivan Nova, who struggled through spring training, impressed in his first start of the season.

But everyone wants to feel good about themselves.\xe2\x80\x9dWhen Nova arrived at the ballpark Monday with Freddy Garcia, Nova told Garcia that there were situations last season when Nova would start during a cold stretch in the season and reversed the team\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes with a victory. He told Garcia the same could happen in his first start, and he proved correct. Nova allowed two runs in seven innings while striking out seven and not walking anyone. He threw first-pitch strikes against 16 of 29 batters in earning the win.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to be the stopper,\xe2\x80\x9d Nova said. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to win every day, whether I pitch or not.\xe2\x80\x9d [{""headline"":""Sports"",""summary"":""Get the big sports news, highlights and analysis from Times journalists, delivered to your inbox every week."",""product-code"":""SP"",""product-title"":""Sports"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/sports?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=SP&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""},{""headline"":""Race\\/Related Newsletter"",""summary"":""Join a deep and provocative exploration of race with New York Times journalists."",""product-code"":""RR"",""product-title"":""Race Related"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/race-related?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=new&contentId=RR&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""},{""headline"":""Your Money"",""summary"":""Every week, get tips on retirement, paying for college, credit cards and the right way to invest."",""product-code"":""MY"",""product-title"":""Your Money"",""sample-url"":""http:\\/\\/www.nytimes.com\\/newsletters\\/sample\\/your-money?pgtype=subscriptionspage&version=business&contentId=MY&eventName=sample&module=newsletter-sign-up""}]      Please verify you\'re not a robot by clicking the box.

Girardi remained vague on what he said, insisting that it was important the players trust that what is said in the clubhouse remains in the clubhouse.

But Girardi was a reserve catcher and a bench coach when Steinbrenner\xe2\x80\x99s wrath loomed over the clubhouse, so he knows what life was once like for a Yankees manager.Another person who understands that role is Orioles Manager Buck Showalter, who spent four seasons leading the Yankees in the early 1990s. Showalter offered little reaction to his former club\xe2\x80\x99s slow start other than acknowledging that the Yankees would eventually turn things around. Showalter said the Yankees had too much talent and too big a payroll to creep in the standings for too long. He was more concerned about the Orioles, who have not had a winning season since 1997 and finished last in the American League East in three of the past four years.By the time Mariano Rivera took the mound in the ninth, the 25,478 in attendance had dwindled to a disproportional amount of pinstriped jerseys and blue caps paying respect to their longtime closer.

Okay, raise your hand if you got this question right in the pre-season contest. Yep, didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Also raise your hand if you thought Boston AND New York would get swept to start the season and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would lead the league in runs allowed with just five. Yep, didn\xe2\x80\x99t think so. Of course, this is just one series, but you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to take what you can get.   If you ignore only scoring one run off of a long reliever making a spot start, the offense really kicked off the season nicely. Nick Markakis had two home runs and a triple (not kidding). A bunch of other guys (Jones, Hardy, Wieters) hit home runs as well and/or had multi-hit games. Even Ronny Paulino was 4 for 4. The real story, however, was the pitching. Jake Arrieta returned from season-ending surgery to pitch seven solid innings. Tommy Hunter had a good start. Jason Hammel took a no-no bid into the eight. Yep. Solid. Oddly enough, Kevin Gregg didn\xe2\x80\x99t pitch and the Orioles won three games. Coincidence?  Different story on the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 side of things where the pitching wasn\xe2\x80\x99t as great (see Mariano Rivera and C.C. Sabathia) and the offense was somewhat non-existent. Here\xe2\x80\x99s hoping the left-handed portion of the Orioles rotation continues that trend.     Game 1 (Monday @ 7:05pm):  Probable Pitchers:  NYY \xe2\x80\x93 Ivan Nova (0-0, 0.00 ERA) BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Matusz (0-0, 0.00 ERA)  Scouting Report:  Relies mostly on three pitches (four-seam fastball, curveball, change-up). Added a slider this past season, but does not use it often (just 3.7 percent of his pitches). Fastball sits in the low 90s. Keeps the majority of his pitches away, but came in on lefties with the slider.     Key Stats:  Matt Wieters is the only current Oriole with a home run off of Nova, although he\xe2\x80\x99s just 2 for 8 overall. Nick Markakis is 4 for 9 (.444) with 2 doubles. Robert Andino does not have a hit in 8 ABs against the right-hander. Robinson Cano and Derek Jeter are both 8 for 19 (.421) off of Matusz. Brett Gardner is hit-less in 10 tries, while Nick Swisher has just 1 hit in 16 ABs.     Game 2 (Tuesday @ 7:05pm):  Probable Pitchers:  NYY \xe2\x80\x93 Freddy Garcia (0-0, 0.00 ERA) BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Wei-Yin Chen (0-0, 0.00 ERA)  Scouting Report:  Fastball velocity has declined somewhat (averaging about 87 in 2011 and 88 in 2010). Steep drop-off on his use of the changeup over the last season. Threw the change around 34 percent of the time in 2010, but just 20 percent in 2011. Also throws a slider, curve, and splitter/sinker \xe2\x80\x93 keeps them away for the most part.  Key Stats:  Many current O\xe2\x80\x99s have decent numbers off of Garcia, including Ronny Paulino (3 for 3 with a HR), Nick Markakis (5 for 13), and Mark Reynolds (4 for 12, 2 HR). Nick Johnson is just 2 for 10 lifetime, but does have a HR. The Yankees will face Wei-Yin Chen for the first time.     Game 3 (Wednesday @ 7:05pm)  Probable Pitchers:  NYY \xe2\x80\x93 C.C. Sabathia (0-0, 7.50 ERA) BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Jake Arrieta (1-0, 0.00 ERA)  Scouting Report:  Repertoire includes a fastball, sinker, slider, and changeup. Really upped use of the slider over the past season (up to 26 percent from 18). Fastball sits around 93, while the slider drops off to 81. In his first start this season, he threw a large percentage of sinkers and sliders.  Key Stats:  Not great numbers for the Orioles off of Sabathia, although in limited ABs. Of those with double digit ABs, Robert Andino (5 for 16), Adam Jones (11 for 33), and Nolan Reimold (8 for 20) have the best numbers. Nick Markakis (3 doubles and a HR) also hits well against CC. Among the other active Orioles are Chris Davis (0-2, 2Ks), Nick Johnson (0-3), Mark Reynolds (0-6, 3Ks), JJ Hardy (0-4), Ronny Paulino (0-4, 2Ks), and Matt Wieters (2-18, 8Ks). Some decent stats for the Yankees off of Arrieta, including Derek Jeter (5-12) and Mark Teixeira (5-13). Curtis Granderson has the Yankees lone home run off of the Orioles right-hander. Brett Gardner is 2 for 11 lifetime and Nick Swisher is hit-less in 13 ABs.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: It was bound to happen - birdswatcher.com', 'The good news is that the O\xe2\x80\x99s still have a winning record and thus in that case they\xe2\x80\x99re still masters of their domain. However in posting their first loss of the season, they also became the first victim to lose to the NY Yankees. As I said this morning, you\xe2\x80\x99re either catching New York at the right time or you\xe2\x80\x99re catching them when they\xe2\x80\x99re ticked off at the world. Tonight we saw what was behind door number two with the final score being New York 6, Orioles 2.Brian Matusz struggled from the outset of the ballgame, throwing 30 pitches in the first inning. It seemed fairly obvious to me that Matusz was somewhat intimidated by the New York\xe2\x80\x99s imposing lineup. Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s line: 4 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 4 BB, 1 K. Matusz threw 96 pitches over four innings. As I tweeted during the game, Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s two-seam fastball was either not sinking, or he was nervous. I\xe2\x80\x99d chalk it up to some of both. He needs to work on keeping the ball down, however he also appeared to be a bit spooked at facing the Yankees. Either way the result is what it is. Part of the issues that the Orioles have had over the years against teams like the Yankees is that Oriole pitchers have tried to nibble at the outside edges of the strike zone. NY\xe2\x80\x99s a team that mandates that you throw the ball in the middle of the plate, otherwise they won\xe2\x80\x99t even offer. Think back to the weekend against Minnesota; Arrieta, Hunter, and Hammel attacked the strike zone, bringing much success to the Orioles.In fairness, the Birds had a few scoring opportunities, none of which they took advantage (aside from Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 homer in the second inning). Mark Reynolds was stranded at third in the second, and Wieters and Adam Jones were stranded at the corners in the sixth. So the Birds did have chances to close the gap between them and NY. If that happens who knows how the games unfold. However that\xe2\x80\x99s baseball as they say.If you\xe2\x80\x99re looking for a silver lining, Matt Wieters was 4-for-4 at the plate. One thing that I along with just about everyone else was Nick Markakis arguing balls and strikes with home plate umpire Paul Schreiber in the last of the eighth. Markakis took a called strike two and three in his at-bat on pitches that appeared to be well outside. Markakis is a guy that\xc2\xa0says nary a word to anyone much less an umpire. However in my opinion he fell victim to an umpire that might well have had dinner reservations at Sabatino\xe2\x80\x99s or perhaps Bo Brooks. In general the Yankees aren\xe2\x80\x99t a team that needs help from the umpiring crew when it comes to the strike zone. Manager Buck Showalter came out to protect Markakis, and the fact that Schreiber allowed Markakis and Showalter to both have their say without being run out of the ballgame is telling to me.Whenever a player puts on a uniform to go out and play his goal is going to be to win. However it goes without saying that you\xe2\x80\x99re not going to win every game out of 162. So while I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to offer praise for this game by any means, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost good that this game happened when it did. Certainly Brian Matusz didn\xe2\x80\x99t help his long-term stability on the roster by any means (not to say that he should or will be on his way to Norfolk after one start), however again it\xe2\x80\x99s impossible to win every game. My point is that it\xe2\x80\x99s almost a blessing in disguise that the O\xe2\x80\x99s got a loss out of the way so that they can get on with the season.This is important for the Orioles as well as the fans; this game needs to be discarded and left alone. As much as people like me were saying not to get too excited about 3-0, people can\xe2\x80\x99t allow themselves to think that the sky is falling now. If it is, then the Birds have158 pointless games ahead of them moving forward.

The Orioles have opened the season with what manager Buck Showalter willingly concedes is an ""unconventional"" bullpen, which could leave him and baseball operations chief Dan Duquette with some explaining to do if the starting pitchers aren\'t able to provide enough good innings to keep the relievers fresh. The Orioles do not have a true long reliever to pick up the slack if the starters again make a habit of stalling in the early and middle innings. That might change over the next few weeks \xe2\x80\x94 as circumstances dictate \xe2\x80\x94 but the team clearly is hoping that the rotation will go deep in enough games to make it a non-issue. Sound familiar? If you recall, the Orioles entered last season banking heavily on their stable of inexperienced starters to keep the club competitive, only to have the rotation unravel early and the bullpen wilt from overwork. Both Showalter and former president of baseball operations Andy MacPhail would later admit they knew they were playing some long odds, which is why Duquette spent the winter stockpiling pitchers. var adSkipCounter = 0;  There are some similarities between this April and last, but it\'s not Groundhog Day. The Orioles have far more rotation depth than they did a year ago, but there is still no guarantee that the starters will consistently get into the sixth and seventh inning and seventh inning, so the lack of a legitimate long guy could come back to haunt them. ""That\'s missing\xe2\x80\xa6I get that,\'\' Showalter said. ""It\'s not conventional right now, but it\'s what\'s best for our organization over the long haul."" This is where it gets complicated. The reason the bullpen seems out of balance is \xe2\x80\x94 at least in part \xe2\x80\x94 because Duquette and Showalter packed the roster with so many major league set-up guys that they couldn\'t justify keeping somebody like Alfredo Simon or Dana Eveland around to soak up non-critical innings. There also is no left-handed specialist to match up in key late-inning situations. It\'s a strange mix, but Showalter seems oddly comfortable with it, at least for the moment. He used former closer Kevin Gregg, left-handed middleman Troy Patton and right-hander Darren O\'Day to hold things together after Brian Matusz lasted just four innings on Monday night, and said that the bullpen would be OK for any eventuality afterWei-Yin Chen took the mound on Tuesday for his American major league debut. Of course, it didn\'t hurt that the Orioles got three spectacular starts to open the season, so Showalter was searching for innings for some of his relievers. ""We had two guys I definitely wanted to get pitch in the game [Monday] night \xe2\x80\x94 Kevin and Darren,\'\' Showalter said. ""They needed to pitch. I felt real comfortable extending them. We were fortunate to get through that game and have everybody available (Tuesday). In the future, that\'s not something you\'re going to be able to weather if you have it three or four days in a row with any type of bullpen."" Fair enough, but if the Orioles do have a long run of short starts, they probably would be better served to have at least one guy who can take the mound in the fifth inning and finish the game. But Showalter would rather focus on the extra options he has at Triple-A Norfolk if he needs to replace a struggling starter. ""I think it\'s more about trying to make sure we don\'t have that happen as often as it did last year and the challenge that it presented,\'\' he said. ""Because of that, I remember having two or three conversations with relievers who didn\'t deserve to (be sent down), but we had to do that not put anybody at risk physically."" It didn\'t have to be this way. Duquette could have kept the versatile (but inconsistent) Simon and started O\'Day in Norfolk, but chose to let Simon be claimed off waivers by the Cincinnati Reds. The next best option might be Jason Berken, who pitched four shutout innings in his first start for the Tides on Monday. Showalter will tell you that it\'s not a problem until it becomes one, but he\'s not going to make the same mistake the club made last year and bank so heavily on the precarious promise of a best-case scenario. The Orioles\' chances of being competitive this year depend almost entirely on the ability of the rotation to pitch deep into games on a frequent and regular basis, but it would be foolhardy to assume anything after a handful of strong performances. ""That\'s would be nice to say,\'\' he said, ""but I don\'t think we have enough of a sampling to know that\'s going to happen. No track record. We hope we have that potential. If we have to make an adjustment, we will. We\'ll certainly have more pieces to choose from."" peter.schmuck@baltsun.com Read Peter Schmuck\'s blog, The Schmuck Stops Here, at baltimoresun.com/schmuckblog and listen when he hosts ""The Week in Review"" at noon Fridays on WBAL (1090 AM) and at wbal.com Orioles Insider | Live scores | Photos | Baseball app     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

For Garcia, there were five wild pitches, tied for the fourth most by a pitcher since 1918.

New York won 5-4. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) After Freddy Garcia was done with his wild performance and Taiwan native Wei-Yin Chen had experienced the thrill of pitching in the major leagues for the first time, the Baltimore Orioles and New York Yankees kept threatening to score and repeatedly failed to do so.Raul Ibanez finally decided the battle of missed opportunities in the 12th inning, delivering a two-out double to score the go-ahead run and provide the Yankees with a 5-4 victory Tuesday night.''It just seemed to be one of those games for both teams. We had our opportunities to score runs,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ''It was a strange day. Just a strange day.''Both teams had trouble delivering in the clutch on a chilly night at Camden Yards. New York went 2 for 18 with runners in scoring position and the Orioles 0 for 8.And that was only part of it.Garcia and Orioles left-hander Wei-Yin Chen both had memorable performances. Garcia threw five wild pitches, one short of the major league record, and Chen took a 4-1 lead into the sixth inning in his major league debut.In the sixth, the Yankees used three hits, a walk and a costly error by third baseman Mark Reynolds to pull even. With two outs, Orioles manager Buck Showalter worked his way to the mound and took the baseball from the 26-year-old Taiwan native.''When Buck walked to me I was pretty upset about myself because I didn't have command tonight,'' Chen said through an interpreter. ''I didn't help the team get a win tonight. This is the reason I'm here, to help the team get a win. I'm not satisfied.''Chen gave up a home run to his first batter, Derek Jeter, whose 25th leadoff homer broke a tie with Rickey Henderson for most in franchise history. The former Japanese Central League standout then threw four straight scoreless innings before apparently tiring.''Physically, I'm not tired at all,'' Chen said. ''Mentally, I got tired.''Chen allowed four runs, two earned, and seven hits in 5 2-3 innings. He struck out six, walked one and was lifted after 101 pitches.''To be honest with you guys, this is my first major league outing. I was so nervous,'' Chen said. ''But after the first inning everything was fine for me.''Garcia yielded four runs, three earned, four hits and three walks in 4 2-3 innings. He's the first player to throw five wild pitches in a game since Philadelphia's Ken Howell in 1989.''I didn't really make good pitches tonight. I was all over the place,'' Garcia said. ''I don't remember ever doing that. I don't know how many there were, five, six?''His problem was that he couldn't get a grip on the split-finger fastball, his money pitch.''To only give up four hits in almost five innings is pretty amazing considering you don't have one of your main pitches,'' Garcia said.Robinson Cano led off the 12th with a double off Pedro Strop (0-1). Four batters later, Ibanez hit a liner off the right-field warning track that bounced into the stands.Former Oriole Clay Rapada (1-0) got two outs in the 11th, and Mariano Rivera worked a perfect 12th for his first save this year and the 604th of his career.Chen began his long-awaited debut by missing the strike zone on three straight pitches. Jeter then took a strike before driving a fastball well over the center-field wall. Nick Swisher followed with a double, but Chen worked out of trouble despite hitting Alex Rodriguez with a pitch.Garcia was even shakier in the bottom half. After J.J. Hardy hit a solo homer, Nick Markakis walked and Matt Wieters singled with two outs. Garcia then threw a pair of wild pitches that enabled Markakis to score the go-ahead run.The next flurry of activity came in the Baltimore fourth. Adam Jones led off with a double, took third on a wild pitch and scored when catcher Russell Martin dropped a throw to the plate.Chen retired 12 straight batters before Martin's one-out single in the fifth. Brett Gardner also singled, and both runners moved up on a groundout by Jeter before Swisher flied out.Baltimore made it 4-1 in the bottom half when Robert Andino doubled, advanced on a sacrifice and scored on a wild pitch.In the sixth, Reynolds let in a run when he mishandled a sharp two-out grounder by Martin, and Gardner hit an RBI single to end Chen's outing.NOTES: New York clinched another series win over Baltimore.

A game that seemed to  be going the Orioles\' way for the first half took an ugly turn in a  mistake-prone sixth inning, as the O\'s frittered away a three-run lead  and then stopped hitting for the rest of the night. The Birds wasted a  valiant effort by six pitchers with a shoddy defensive display and an  0-for-8 mark with runners in scoring position.Tonight  marked the major-league debut of lefty Wei-Yin Chen-- a fact that  didn\'t go unnoticed by his home country, judging by the army of  Taiwanese reporters who descended on Camden Yards for the occasion. Chen  is just the fourth native of Taiwan ever to start a game in the major  leagues, and his outing was broadcast live at 7 in the morning in his  homeland. So to any Taiwanese readers who have stumbled upon this recap,  may I say: [Note to self: Find a Taiwanese phrase to copy and paste here. Don\'t forget to do this before publishing.]Chen\'s  debut didn\'t exactly get off to a sizzling start. The very first  big-league batter he faced, Derek Jeter, crushed a leadoff homerun to  straightaway center field. Oof. The next hitter, Nick Swisher, smashed  another blast to nearly the same spot, this one banging off the wall for  a double. Robinson Cano, too, jumped on another hanger and lifted it  deep to center, but this time Adam Jones was able to track it down for  an out. So Chen\'s first three batters went: a deep fly over the wall, a  deep fly off the wall, and a deep fly caught in front of the wall. At  least you\'re gradually moving in the right direction, Wei-Yin!In  fact, Chen improved almost immediately, and strung together a bunch of  nice innings in a row. He stranded two runners in the first, getting  another flyout followed by a nasty slider to fan Curtis Granderson. That  began a streak of 12 batters in a row retired by Chen, with half of  them on strikeouts. He began mixing his pitches much more effectively  and keeping the ball down, stymieing the Yankees with a low-90s fastball  along with a curveball at 73-74 mph and a changeup at 83 to go with his  sharp slider. That first-inning misstep aside, it wasn\'t hard to see  why the 26-year-old Chen was so highly touted in Japan. I am officially  intrigued. Meanwhile,  the Orioles quickly answered back against Yankees starter Freddy  Garcia. Orioles batters really didn\'t need to do anything but stand  around and watch Garcia self-destruct-- that is, when they weren\'t  jackknifing out of the way of his ridiculously off-target offerings. To  say he was wild would be an understatement.Garcia  did groove one fat pitch in the first inning, and J.J. Hardy crushed it  into the left-field seats for his second homerun, tying the score at 1.  After that, Garcia couldn\'t find the plate. He allowed a walk, a  single, and the uncorked two consecutive wild pitches with Nick Johnson at bat, one of which nearly shaved off Nick\'s horrendous mustache. That  plated Nick Markakis to give the O\'s a 2-1 lead. Garcia labored through  35 pitches in the inning, and it wasn\'t the last time he\'d struggle.In  the fourth, Jones ripped a double on the first pitch, and Garcia  promptly bounced another wild pitch to move him to third. A Matt Wieters walk put runners at the corners. Johnson then tapped a grounder to  first; Mark Teixeira fielded and stepped on first, then threw to second.  With the force play off, Wieters wisely got himself caught in a  rundown, allowing Jones to take off for the plate. Jeter fired home, but  catcher Russell Martin dropped the ball and Adam dove past him to  score. Later in the inning, Garcia threw his FOURTH wild pitch, but it  didn\'t hurt him.The  Yanks made some noise in the fifth with a pair of one-out singles, but  Chen retired Jeter and Swisher to escape the jam, with third baseman  Mark Reynolds making a nice diving stop to rob a hit. Garcia wasn\'t so  lucky. With Robert Andino at third, he uncorked his FIFTH WILD PITCH of  the game to plate the run. Incredible. Garcia only threw four wild  pitches in the entire 2011 season, and then surpassed that total here in  his first outing of 2012. He\'s the first pitcher in 23 years to throw  five wild pitches in a game. Garcia was pulled without finishing the  fifth.The  Orioles carried a 4-1 lead to the top of the sixth with Chen cruising.  What could possibly go wrong?! Well, it\'s the Orioles, so...quite a bit.  Chen began to tire, loading the bases with one out on a pair of singles  and a walk. Then, the Orioles\' defense self-destructed. Andruw Jones lifted a fly ball to medium-deep right field. Markakis should have had  plenty of time to get a running start, make the catch, and put his  momentum into a strong throw to the plate. Instead, he inexplicably  caught the ball flat-footed with no head of steam, then lobbed a  terrible hopping throw home that the runner beat for the Yankees\' second  run. C\'mon, Nick. You\'re usually better than that.Mark  Reynolds, however, isn\'t. The noted defensive butcher picked a terrible  time for his latest miscue. Chen should\'ve been out of the inning on a  Martin sharp bouncer to third, but Reynolds was handcuffed by a short  hop and let the ball clank off his body for a critical error. Teixeira  scored to cut the O\'s lead to 4-3. We kept hearing how hard Reynolds  worked on improving his defense this past offseason. When do you think  we might, you know, see some actual results?Even  with Chen at 100 pitches, Buck Showalter left him in to face the  lefty-swinging Brett Gardner. Gardner ripped the first pitch into right  field for a game-tying RBI single. That\'s a back-breaker. And with that,  Chen\'s debut was finished. A rough start and a rough finish, but he was  great in the middle. In 5 \xe2\x85\x94 innings, he gave up four runs, but only two  earned. His teammates let him down in that final inning, and Buck left  him in a couple batters too long. Matt Lindstrom spared him from further  damage, getting Jeter to ground out to strand two in the sixth.Then  nobody scored for a long, long time. It wasn\'t for lack of  opportunities, though. In the top of the seventh, Swisher was awarded  first base on a hit-by-pitch, despite the fact that, #1, he swung at the  pitch, and #2, the ball might not have even hit him. Typical Yankee  shenanigans. Still, it all worked out OK. Cano followed with a double  down the left-field line, but the O\'s pulled off a perfect relay--  Chavez-to-Hardy-to-Wieters-- to throw out Swisher trying to score. A  thing of beauty! Lindstrom then struck out two batters to strand Cano at  second.Lindstrom  was the first of several impressive Orioles relievers. Luis Ayala worked a scoreless eighth with two strikeouts, and Jim Johnson stranded  Jeter after a leadoff single in the ninth. Unfortunately for the  Orioles, the Yanks\' bullpen was equally effective. Rookie David Phelps  retired all seven batters he faced, racking up four strikeouts against  an increasingly hapless O\'s offense. David Robertson handled a scoreless  eighth.The  Orioles wasted a golden opportunity to walk off with a win in the  ninth. Pinch-hitter Nolan Reimold led off with a weak grounder that  squirted into right field for a single. Reynolds popped out, but Chris  Davis singled into right field. The ball was hit slowly enough that I  thought Nolan should\'ve been able to get to third, but he slammed on the  brakes after rounding second. A Robert Andino fielder\'s choice put  runners at the corners with two outs. The Yankees decided to  intentionally walk Chavez to face Hardy, which is nonsensical, even with  righty Cory Wade on the  mound. But it paid off for them. An  overaggressive J.J. hacked at the second pitch and popped out harmlessly  to short, leaving the bases loaded. Sigh. And we\'re on to extra  innings.Troy  Patton mowed through a perfect 10th, and Pedro Strop worked past a  leadoff walk to keep the Yankees off the board in the 11th. But the  Orioles\' offense still couldn\'t do anything. Wade struck out two in the  10th, then combined with ex-Oriole Clay Rapada on a 1-2-3 11th inning.  The O\'s managed a grand total of 6 hits in this 12-inning game. Not  gonna get it done, guys.The  madness came to an end in the 12th, with the Orioles unsurprisingly on  the losing end. Strop, working his second inning, gave up a leadoff  double to Cano off the glove of a leaping Reynolds. The potential  go-ahead run then moved to third on a groundout. Reynolds suffered  another embarrassing lapse when, on a Teixeira foul pop-up near third  base, he somehow lost track of the ball and let it fall behind him,  giving away a huge out. It didn\'t end up mattering-- Teixeira was  retired on a bouncer to second, with Cano holding at third-- but it  added yet more ammunition for the ""Move Mark Reynolds off of third base""  crowd.With  two outs and Cano still at third, Showalter decided to intentionally  walk the dangerous Granderson to pitch to the 800-year-old Raul Ibanez.  It was a fine idea, until Strop hung a terrible slider on a 1-2 pitch  and Ibanez clubbed it for an RBI double that hopped over the right-field  wall. With that, the Yankees had taken a 5-4 lead.That\'s  all they would need for ageless closer Mariano Rivera, who set down the  Orioles in perfect order in the 12th. And sure, there were a few  questionable strike calls by erratic home plate ump Tim Welke-- whose  strike zone was inconsistent all night-- but it\'s hard to put blame on  the umpiring when the Orioles had dozens of chances to win this game and  couldn\'t take advantage. Let\'s hope this game isn\'t a harbinger of the  season to come.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

New York won 6-4 in 10 innings. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) The New York Yankees have grown accustomed to beating the Baltimore Orioles, even if it occasionally takes some additional work to accomplish the feat.Nick Swisher hit a two-run homer in the 10th, and New York defeated the Baltimore Orioles 6-4 Wednesday night for their second straight extra-inning win and a three-game sweep.Curtis Granderson homered and drove in three runs for the Yankees, who won consecutive extra-inning road games for the first time since July 16-17, 2001, at Philadelphia, according to STATS LLC.New York has won 16 of 21 against the Orioles since the beginning of last season. During that time, the Yankees are 5-2 in extra innings against Baltimore.''I thought our guys responded well under some tough circumstances with two extra-inning wins,'' manager Joe Girardi said.After winning the opener of the series 6-2, New York went 12 innings on Tuesday night before going overtime again in the finale. New York now heads home to face the Los Angeles Angels on Friday after a 3-3 start on the road.''It's nice to go home. Everyone is excited to go home,'' Girardi said. ''It is nice to get the sweep.''With two outs in the 10th, Mark Teixeira hit an opposite-field pop off Kevin Gregg (0-1) that landed just inside the left-field line and between third baseman Mark Reynolds and left fielder Nolan Reimold.Swisher then worked the count full before hitting a no-doubt drive into the center-field bleachers.''I was really excited to get that hit at the end of the game, so excited to come out of here with a sweep,'' Swisher said.Rafael Soriano (1-0) worked 1 1-3 innings of one-hit relief and 42-year-old Mariano Rivera got three outs for his second save of the season and No. 605 of his career. One night earlier, Rivera sealed a 5-4, 12-inning win.New York starter CC Sabathia gave up four runs and eight hits in six innings, striking out eight and walking two. The left-hander won his previous seven starts at Camden Yards, and although that streak ended, he retained his 16-2 record against Baltimore.Sabathia took a beating on the mound in a fashion that had nothing to do with his pitching line. He was smacked in his left hand trying to catch a bouncer up in the middle in the second inning and had a line drive hit his left foot in the fifth.Robert Andino and Reynolds had two RBIs apiece for the Orioles, and starter Jake Arrieta allowed four runs and five hits in 6 2-3 innings.''We fought. We put ourselves in the situation,'' Baltimore center fielder Adam Jones said. ''We came back and we just kept fighting, fighting, fighting. They had the big hit, and we didn't have the big hit. We had the opportunity to get it, and we didn't get it.''Reynolds hit a two-run, two-out double in the fifth inning to give Baltimore a 4-3 lead. Although he walked twice earlier, Reynolds was 0 for 6 with three strikeouts against Sabathia.New York pulled even in the seventh. After Orioles manager Buck Showalter lifted Arrieta with a runner on first and two outs, Luis Ayala promptly walked Derek Jeter on five pitches, and Granderson bounced an RBI single into left field.The Yankees put runners at second and third with two outs in the eighth before Ayala struck out Russell Martin.After throwing seven shutout innings against Minnesota on opening day, Arrieta's perfect ERA vanished when Jeter led off with a double and Granderson followed with his first home run, which also provided his first two RBIs.Arrieta retired the next 11 batters before Teixeira singled with two outs in the fourth.Sabathia struck out three of the first four batters before Matt Wieters singled and Reynolds walked. Sabathia then tried to barehand a smash up the middle by Ronny Paulino, and although the ball struck his hand, he wasn't hurt.''It is a natural reaction, but I won't do it again,'' Sabathia said.The single loaded the bases, and Andino tied it by lining a two-out single to center.Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs in the third before Paulino hit into a force play. By then, however, Sabathia's pitch count was already at 74.New York took advantage of a wild streak by Arrieta to take a 3-2 lead in the fifth. A walk, a hit batter and a single loaded the bases with no outs for Jeter, who drove in a run with a chop off the plate.NOTES: The start of the game was delayed by rain for 20 minutes. ...

04/13/2012,"[('Orioles 7, Blue Jays 5: A night for the chicks - Camden Chat', "" They always say that chicks dig the long ball, and if that's so, then tonight was a night for the chicks. Despite playing in a sterile, wind-free dome environment, there were seven home runs on the game, all solo shots. Three of these were hit by the Orioles and four by the Blue Jays. For a while, the game was looking like whoever would hit the last home run would be the winner, but the O's scratched out enough other runs to overcome the home run gap to take a 7-5 victory in the opening game of the series. Maybe there's something about that Canadian air. Or maybe it was just a couple of pitchers who weren't that sharp, playing hitters who were ready to crush baseballs a long way.  Whatever it was, both teams seemed to benefit from it tonight. From Kelly Johnson in the bottom of the first inning to Nolan Reimold in the top of the ninth, the balls flew out of there. On the MASN broadcast, Jim Hunter kept talking about how the ball was carrying, which I mocked, because it's not like there's a breeze in the dome, but maybe there's something else. Or who knows, maybe the ball gets caught in a jet stream of heating and air conditioning. On a night where Tommy Hunter was the O's starter, the prospect of a home run fest probably didn't seem too positive. Hunter, a contact pitcher, would seem to be at a disadvantage against Jays starter Brandon Morrow, a strikeout pitcher, in a game of home runs. O's batters were up to the task, though, trading home runs with the Jays through the first six innings. Hunter gave up six hits in his six innings of work, but four of them were the home run balls. Fortunately, they were all solo home runs. An unearned run was added to his total thanks to a mess of a play by Nolan Reimold in the 4th inning, a two-base error that was compounded by a poor throw that allowed a runner to score. Hunter was chased after walking the leadoff hitter in the top of the 7th, with a final line of five runs, four earned, on six hits, with two strikeouts and two walks. He had only thrown 84 pitches. Perhaps he ought to have gone longer, but after watching the four bombs, it's hard to argue with a change. This is going to be the Tommy Hunter experience. He won't strike out a lot of guys, and so there will be a lot of contact, and sometimes that contact will go a long way when there is a cutter that doesn't cut, or a slider that doesn't slide. Some nights this will happen, and the O's offense won't be on target, and he will lose. Other nights it will happen and the O's will score runs and he will win.    When Robert Andino is crushing balls to straight-away center field, though, you have to wonder if maybe there is something funny in the air. They might not have won the home run race, but there was more offensive output to bridge the gap.    Reimold made up for his error with a 3-5 night that included a home run of his own, and three runs scored. That's a good night. He is hitting .308 on the young season, which sounds good, although he hasn't walked yet, which is not so good for a leadoff hitter. The other O's home runs were hit by Andino and Adam Jones, who had a three-hit night of his own. Each time the O's chipped up a run off Morrow - who had a 10+ K/9 last year but only struck out four Orioles tonight - they were soon after equalized by the Jays, who had home runs from Johnson, Colby Rasmus, Yunel Escobar, and Edwin Encarnacion. Strangely, on a night of home runs, none of them were hit by two-time reigning home run world champion Jose Bautista.    The O's entered the top of the 8th with a 5-4 deficit, and you had to wonder if they were going to score again. Reimold led off with a single, then J.J. Hardy struck out against Toronto reliever Jason Frasor. The Toronto bullpen had four lefties on the night, so they summoned the venerable Darren Oliver to face Nick Markakis. Nolan must have felt feisty, because he swiped second, and Markakis moved him over to third in the process of beating out an infield single. Jones followed this up with a slapdick kind of moment, striking out, but Matt Wieters walked to load the bases, and then Wilson Betemit stepped up to the plate. If I could trash an Orioles player in a given game thread and know that player was going to come through with the go-ahead runs, I'd trash people every night. I do not have that power. Betemit was the target of my ire tonight, because all indications are that he's worse at third base than Mark Reynolds. He had a couple of chances tonight, made a couple of questionable throws that Chris Davis corralled in time, and that was that. Then he came up to bat in the top of the 8th, his team down to four outs, and came through with a ground ball up the middle that you would call a worm burner in a baseball stadium that actually had grass. After Hunter left the game, the Orioles initiated Operation No Crappy Relievers, with Darren O'Day stranding the inherited runner in the 7th, Pedro Strop sealing a scoreless 8th and Jim Johnson picking up his third save of the year with a scoreless 9th. The Orioles can look to guarantee a series win in tomorrow afternoon's 4:07pm game. Jason Hammel pitches for the O's and Henderson Alvarez for the Jays. With the win, the Orioles raised their record to 4-3, and brought themselves back up into a tie for first place in the American League East, following an earlier Tampa Bay loss. Whether or not chicks dig the long ball, they certainly dig the Orioles in first place.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

At first, it was a game about a starting pitcher struggling with his command and getting knocked around. Jason Hammel, who flirted with a no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins, simply was not that same crisp pitcher right out of the gate. He fell behind his batter batter 3-0. By the time he had bases loaded with two outs in the second inning and the imposing figure of Jose Bautista standing in the batter\'s box, Hammel had thrown 54 pitches and the Orioles were down 2-1. Then, Brett Lawrie decided to do his best Adam Savage impression on the phrase ""fortune favors the bold"", attempting to steal home. He was thrown out easily, ending Toronto\'s opportunity to put the knock-out punch on Hammel. And suddenly, for one reason or another, everything was different. Hammel breezed through the third inning on fifteen pitches. He breezed through the fourth on fourteen pitches. The fifth only took him twelve pitches. Meanwhile, Chris Davis proved his scouting report highly accurate by destroying a hanging mistake pitch for his first home run of the season, giving the O\'s a 3-2 lead in the fourth inning. The game was now about a pitcher settling down and the Orioles cruising to a victory on the back of a clutch homer.    Enter from stage left: Matt Lindstrom, who promptly pitched into a meltdown with an assist from noted non-Reynolds third baseman Wilson Betemit. Betemit missed a highly field-able ball for an error. That would have been the second out, and the inning would have ended on Eric Thames\' fly-out, but instead Thames was credited with a game-tying sacrifice fly, and the inning ended with the Jays up 4-3. Betemit then completed his impression of Mark Reynolds by lining a home run in the 8th off Casey Janssen to tie the game back up. So we settled in for yet another game of bullpen attrition. After the marathon Yankee series, I\'m beginning to worry about bullpen attrition myself. Enter from stage right: Nolan Reimold. Now, for the past three years a lot of us Oriole bloggers have been waiting for this exact kind of opportunity for Reimold. The guy has power and on-base skills, and those are kind of the two things you really want from baseball hitters. He pulled a monster clutch two run home run off Francisco Cordero in the top of the ninth to give the Orioles the lead, and you know what? When Reimold is The Guy, it is extra awesome for me.      Then Jim Johnson came on and pitched a quick ninth inning despite a defensive misplay from first baseman Ryan Flaherty. Funny that, a closer with an ability to close games without a lot of drama.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles win the series in Toronto - birdswatcher.com', 'In the past few seasons we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the Orioles and Toronto Blue Jays play games where Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s jumped way out in front of the Birds early on. Through the first two games of their series in 2012, we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen the exact opposite; back-and-forth affairs that have been battles to the end. The other big difference is that the Orioles have won both of these two games, which always helps in the way of confidence as well as in the win/loss column.Jason Hammel was a far cry from his form last week when he took a no-hitter into the 8th inning. Through five innings, Hammel gave up 6 hits, 2 runs, 1 walk, and struck out three. There\xe2\x80\x99s a bit more than meets the eye there however; Hammel had a very tough second inning in which he loaded the bases, only to give up one one run. However that cost Hammel a lot of pitches in doing so. Hammel\xe2\x80\x99s big struggles in the inning were mostly in the beginning part there of. With one gone he struck out Kelly Johnson for the second out and Brett Lawrie on third, bringing Jose Bautista to the plate. Again keep in mind, the bases were loaded\xe2\x80\xa6why Lawrie would attempt to steal home plate in that situation is beyond me.If you didn\xe2\x80\x99t see the game, for the record Lawrie was tagged out by catcher Matt Wieters. It makes absolutely no sense to me why someone would try to steal home plate in that situation (bases juiced and a heavy hitter at the plate) is really baffling to me. This is purely theory, and I have nothing with which to back this up; Toronto is a team that has a reputation for stealing signs. So is it such a stretch to think that IF the Jays were up to those kinds of tactics perhaps someone thought they saw a sign for a specific pitch or location that they truly didn\xe2\x80\x99t? Either that, or maybe were the O\xe2\x80\x99s onto this and perhaps they crossed the Blue Jays up a bit? Again this is all purely speculation, however the fact is that the call to steal home plate in that situation left a lot of people scratching their heads.Chris Davis hit his first home run of 2012 in the top of the 4th to put the O\xe2\x80\x99s ahead 3-2. Davis of course is looked at as a guy that could be a first baseman with some power for the Orioles, which was good to see. Toronto got the lead back in the last of the sixth on the heels of a Wilson Betemit error at the hot corner. That\xe2\x80\x99s right, an error at third but it had nothing to do with Mark Reynolds. The runs were charged to Matt Lindstrom who had come on in relief. In the case of Hammel, he actually left the game in line to be the winner. However as the game moved along it became obvious that neither Hammel or Toronto starter Henderson Alvarez would figure into the decision.Going back to that attempted steal of home plate for a moment, Toronto had two runners in scoring position and a heavy-hitter at the plate. A base hit gives the Blue Jays two runs. Hold that thought for a moment! Wilson Betemit hit a solo home run in the 8th to tie the game at four, atoning for his earlier error. So when Nolan Reimold slugged a two-run homer into the third deck in the top of the ninth. Two runs\xe2\x80\xa6exactly the number of runners in scoring position when Lawrie tried to steal home plate.The O\xe2\x80\x99s have struggled over the years in Toronto, so this will certainly be a joyous Saturday evening for them in knowing that they\xe2\x80\x99ve already won the series. This is not to say that they\xe2\x80\x99re playing with house money going into tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game, however it does make things a bit easier.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Sixty-five years ago, Robinson broke the majors\xe2\x80\x99 racial barrier.Since 2004, Jackie Robinson Day has been a national day of introspection and respect.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Frank Gunn)MoreTORONTO (AP) The Baltimore Orioles didn't score a single run in either the eighth or ninth inning of their first six games. The past two days in Toronto, however, they've started making a habit of it.Nolan Reimold hit a tiebreaking, two-run homer in the ninth and the Orioles beat the Blue Jays 6-4 on Saturday for their second straight comeback win.''It's not how many hits you get all the time, it's when you get them and when guys are on base,'' Reimold said. ''The last two games we've been able to do that late in the game.''Wilson Betemit tied it with a solo homer in the eighth and Chris Davis also went deep for the Orioles, who won their second consecutive game at Rogers Centre. Coming into the series, Baltimore was 5-29 in Toronto dating to 2008 and had not won a series north of the border since June of that year.''Every question seems to be prefaced with how we've struggled here before,'' Reimold said. ''It's good to come in here and have some close ballgames where we do the little things that you've got to do to get the win.''Betemit's go-ahead, two-run single in the eighth inning Friday night rallied Baltimore to a 7-5 victory that snapped a three-game skid.''There's a lot of good karma around our club,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''There has been since spring training started.''Kelly Johnson homered for the Blue Jays, but the bullpen blew another late lead. Toronto relievers have blown four saves this season and are responsible for three of the team's four defeats.Betemit tied it at 4 with a shot to right off Casey Janssen in the eighth. Reimold hit a towering drive to left off Francisco Cordero (0-1), his second homer of the season and second ninth-inning shot in two days.''The home run (Reimold) hit was a hit-and-run,'' Showalter said. ''We're going to change that sign to hit-and-trot. He's been in a good spot.''Luis Ayala (1-0) worked one scoreless inning for the win and Jim Johnson finished for his fourth save. Johnson has converted 12 consecutive save opportunities dating to Aug. 14, 2011.Davis led off the ninth with a single that hit Cordero on the upper right thigh and was replaced by pinch-runner Ryan Flaherty. Roberto Andino struck out but Reimold followed with his homer, Baltimore's sixth in the past two games.When he connected, Reimold wasn't sure his drive was going to stay fair. He soon saw it would.''It was straight enough and I knew it had the distance,'' he said. ''It was a good feeling rounding the bases after that.''The Orioles opened the scoring in the first on a bases-loaded grounder by Matt Wieters, bringing in J.J. Hardy.Baltimore right-hander Jason Hammel, who took a no-hitter into the eighth inning in his season debut against Minnesota last Sunday, didn't keep the Blue Jays in check for long. Toronto's second batter, Johnson, tied it by homering to left in the first.The Blue Jays took the lead with a run in the second, but could have had more. Eric Thames doubled, moved to third on Brett Lawrie's single and scored on a base hit by Colby Rasmus, who was forced at second on J.P. Arencibia's grounder.Yunel Escobar walked to load the bases and Kelly Johnson struck out, bringing up Jose Bautista, who fell behind 0-2 before Lawrie broke for home plate. Hammel stepped off and fired a high throw to Wieters, who blocked the plate with his feet and tagged the sliding Lawrie for the third out.''If we don't have a 6-foot-5 catcher, it may have worked,'' Showalter said.Blue Jays manager John Farrell said Lawrie, who was later thrown out trying to steal second, was guilty of ''youthful exuberance.''''We have to continue to educate the game situations,'' Farrell said. ''When a pitcher is in a prolonged inning, when you're running up a pitch count, you don't want to give away an out on the basepaths, particularly early in the game when you've got a chance to put a crooked number on the board.''Hammel called the play ''a big spot in the game.''''I was surprised,'' Hammel said. ''It was more of a thank you. With Bautista up there and the bases loaded, that's kind of a favor to me for him to try and steal home.''Baltimore reclaimed the lead in the fourth on Davis' first homer of the season, a two-run shot to right that ended a streak of nine straight solo homers by Orioles batters.Toronto answered in the sixth against reliever Matt Lindstrom. Adam Lind hit a one-out double and Edwin Encarnacion reached on Betemit's error at third base, putting runners at the corners for Thames, who tied it with a sacrifice fly. Lawrie walked and Rasmus followed with an RBI single, giving him his first multihit game of the season.Janssen replaced Blue Jays starter Henderson Alvarez in the eighth but failed to hold the lead, allowing a two-out drive to right by Betemit, his first.Hammel allowed two runs and six hits in five innings. Alvarez gave up three runs and six hits in seven innings.NOTES: Toronto closer Sergio Santos (paternity leave) will rejoin the roster Sunday and LHP Aaron Laffey will be optioned to Triple-A Las Vegas. ... Orioles LHP Tsuyoshi Wada (left elbow) pitched six shutout innings in an extended spring training game. He allowed two hits, walked five and struck out seven. Wada is tentatively scheduled to pitch again Thursday in a start for Triple-A Norfolk. ... Showalter said Wieters will likely get his first day off this season in Sunday's series finale. Baltimore LHP Brian Matusz (0-1) faces Toronto RHP Kyle Drabek (1-0).

Camden Yards is the gold standard when it comes to baseball stadiums, offering the look and feel of days gone by while providing an up-to-date experience for today\'s fans.It is equally difficult to fathom that the Baltimore Orioles have been perennial losers for nearly as long. As a lifelong baseball and Orioles fan, I am continually amazed, sickened and depressed by the path the organization has taken. Decades of hard work, dedication and instruction to create the premier farm system in baseball have been wiped away by bad deals, lack of leadership and mismanagement of talent. Cal Ripken Sr.\'s life work has been washed away like the oyster beds of the Chesapeake Bay.Oh, there was a glimmer of hope at the beginning of the 2012 season when our hometown boys swept the gang from Minneapolis in fine fashion, sending them home with their tails tucked between their legs. But then the evil empire flew into town, bringing along their devoted minions to ""Yankee Stadium South"" for three days, laying to waste the perfect season of the Orioles and realigning the American League East to its proper form. Yes, the Big Brother Yankees gave the Little Brother Orioles the noogie they deserved. var adSkipCounter = 0; I\'m tired of Orioles shoving the glory years of the 1970s, \'80s early\'90s and the 20th anniversary of what amounts to a museum down my throat. I\'d like for my two girls to experience winning seasons and perpetual playoff appearances as I did at their age. But no, the Orioles are in another ""rebuilding year"" (is it 15 years now, I\'ve lost track?), which is their constant state of being. It\'s mediocrity at its worst.Peter Angelos has reaped nothing (other than the fans\' hard-earned dollars), and ridden the coat-tails of Earl Weaver, Eddie Murray, Cal Ripken Jr., Jim Palmer, Brooks Robinson and Frank Robinson to the point where it has become a side show.Instead of celebrating the 20th anniversary of Camden Yards and erecting larger than life statues to draw in crowds to recall the glory of years past, how about improving the product on the field? How about saying, ""I\'m sorry for making you endure my whims and making you watch utterly pathetic baseball for over a decade?""The last time I checked Camden Yards was not a museum, and the Baltimore Orioles were a professional baseball team.

Both will be 41 on opening day of their final years. The Angels\xe2\x80\x99 Albert Pujols has just started his deal, and the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Alex Rodriguez is into the fifth year of his.The popular opinion is that Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s deal is crazy, and in lots of ways, it is. Rodriguez spent time on the disabled list in each of the contract\xe2\x80\x99s first four seasons. His bonuses for reaching various home run milestones \xe2\x80\x94 designed to raise the total value above $300 million if he sets the career record \xe2\x80\x94 seem especially odious.But to call that deal a mistake is to miss the point of the game. Rodriguez has led the Yankees to a championship. And if Pujols does the same for the Angels, his deal will have worked out, too.\xe2\x80\x9cA championship is precious, and I never take it for granted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 Mark Teixeira, who is in the fourth year of an eight-year contract. \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe around the Yankees, because there are so many championships, you expect one every year. But the fact of the matter is that\xe2\x80\x99s not going to happen.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Teixeira grew up rooting for the Baltimore Orioles when Cal Ripken was their star. The Orioles won the World Series in 1983, when Teixeira was 3. The Orioles have never been back.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Angels won the World Series in 2002, and since then they have won five division titles without another pennant. If Pujols brings a second championship to a franchise now 51 years old, his contract will be worth it. At least for the first half of the deal, the Angels seem poised to do it.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll worry about the second half if we win a championship,\xe2\x80\x9d said Jerry Dipoto, the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 general manager. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re here every day to find the right combination of players to give us the best chance to do just that. And we\xe2\x80\x99re a better team with Albert Pujols on our club. We\xe2\x80\x99re a better team this year; we\xe2\x80\x99re a better team next year. Baseball is such that we\xe2\x80\x99ll measure Years 5, 6 and 8 when those years come.\xe2\x80\x9dDipoto pitched eight seasons in the majors without reaching the playoffs. He came up with Cleveland but was traded in 1994, a year before the Indians reached the World Series. They got back in 1997, but never won.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Just one ring would have validated the Indians\xe2\x80\x99 core of overwhelming talent \xe2\x80\x94 Albert Belle, Kenny Lofton, Jim Thome, Manny Ramirez \xe2\x80\x94 and meant so much to Cleveland. But it never came, so the legacy is incomplete.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Yankees of the Rodriguez era should always be considered a success. Even one championship is that important. Yes, the early Derek Jeter years brought four World Series victories from 1996 through 2000. But the further we get from those years, the more we should appreciate how special \xe2\x80\x94 how unusual \xe2\x80\x94 that was.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the 11 years since then, nine teams have taken turns as champions. That is the nature of the postseason, which will expand this season from 8 to 10 participants. Winning becomes harder and harder.

For me, I just want to jump up and down on that field. I\xe2\x80\x99m tired of sitting at home and watching these other guys doing it, and I got kicked out.\xe2\x80\x9dPujols\xe2\x80\x99s Cardinals made three World Series, winning two, since the Angels\xe2\x80\x99 last appearance. The Angels imported him largely for business reasons, but also because he can help them do better in October.Yet the length of his deal \xe2\x80\x94 which was recently matched by the Cincinnati Reds\xe2\x80\x99 commitment to first baseman Joey Votto \xe2\x80\x94 was the subject of the first question to Pujols when he met with reporters on Friday. How will these contracts look, he was asked, when the players inevitably decline?  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could tell you,\xe2\x80\x9d Pujols said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen in the future.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Angels think they do. They believe Pujols will continue to produce at an extraordinary level, because of his extraordinary skill.\xe2\x80\x9cAlbert Pujols does things a little bit different, even than the most accomplished hitters,\xe2\x80\x9d Dipoto said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has the strike-zone control of a hit-for-average, contact guy, and he has the power of an elite power hitter of all time. To combine those two, I don\xe2\x80\x99t know why he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t age better than most. It\xe2\x80\x99s something we\xe2\x80\x99re looking at as an advantage that he\xe2\x80\x99s here for 10 years, and it\xe2\x80\x99s something that we want.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Hunter said it made sense to sign Pujols for a decade, because he can shift to designated hitter halfway through the contract. As a first baseman, Hunter said, Pujols does not ask as much of his body as a third baseman like Rodriguez, who was also a base-stealing threat when he signed.\xe2\x80\x9cA-Rod\xe2\x80\x99s a better athlete,\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter said, comparing Rodriguez with first basemen. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s probably why he\xe2\x80\x99s more scrutinized, because he got a 10-year deal as an athlete, and then you\xe2\x80\x99re going to see his athletic ability go down. When you\xe2\x80\x99re at first base, all you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to do is hit. But when you\xe2\x80\x99re an athlete, you know he\xe2\x80\x99s going to decline.\xe2\x80\x9dWhen that decline accelerates, it might be hard for the Yankees to write those lavish paychecks to Rodriguez. But could you imagine the anxiety around this team if it had not won the 2009 championship?

Whether as the Senators, who deserted the city twice, or the Nationals, Washington\xe2\x80\x99s teams have been a fixture at the bottom of the standings. They made it to Broadway in the hit play \xe2\x80\x9cDamn Yankees,\xe2\x80\x9d but in the world of baseball, they have been a continual flop.That may be changing. For the first time since the Expos of Montreal became the Nationals of Washington, in 2005, the team is expected to finish above .500 and even contend for a playoff berth. With a core of young talent, headlined by their ace, Stephen Strasburg, the Nationals are meriting attention in a city otherwise focused on a presidential election.\xe2\x80\x9cIt has certainly created more of a buzz down here, and there are more people paying attention to the Nats than any time since baseball returned to Washington,\xe2\x80\x9d said Greg Hauptman, a native Washingtonian and season-ticket holder who saw the Senators play at Griffith Stadium. \xe2\x80\x9cThis is the first time it\xe2\x80\x99s not just the fan in me thinking this might be the year.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Nationals, at least for now, are rewarding Hauptman. After Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s 6-3 victory over Houston, they were 8-3 and perched atop the National League East.

The team just completed its biggest opening weekend since its current ballpark opened in 2008.

The team is worth $480 million, a 15 percent increase compared with 2011, according to estimates by Forbes magazine, which cited growing revenue and a declining share of debt as a percentage of the team\xe2\x80\x99s worth.The club\xe2\x80\x99s value could grow further if the Nationals can get more from their television contract, which is being renegotiated. MASN, the regional sports network that carries Nationals and Baltimore Orioles games, must pay the teams a market rate, and if the two sides cannot agree on a rate, a mediator will decide, according to two people with knowledge of the arrangement.A bigger local television contract could boost the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 revenue, give them more money to sign free agents and clearly establish them as the top team in the Baltimore-Washington area.

Ryan Zimmerman, the Virginia native who mans third base and who until now has been the anchor of the club, is 27. Strasburg, 23, after a detour caused by arm surgery, seems to be on track to be the electrifying presence he was in 2010, his rookie season. After two starts this year, his earned run average was 0.69; he pitched Monday night against Houston.

(AP Photo/John Smierciak)MoreCHICAGO (AP) Matt Wieters and the Baltimore Orioles shook their struggles with runners on bases in a big 10th inning against the White Sox.Wieters homered twice, including a 10th-inning grand slam, lifting the Baltimore Orioles to a come-from-behind 10-4 win over the Chicago White Sox on Monday night.''We've been battling every game pretty close,'' Wieters said. ''It's nice to have a big inning to kind of put some things together.''Mistakes and missed opportunities left the Orioles trailing 4-1 going into the eighth, but Baltimore hit three solo homers against a pair of relievers to send the game into extra innings.''I think it was almost like letting out some frustration,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''All the things we helped them out with.''The White Sox took a 4-1 lead into the eighth, but Baltimore hit three solo homers against a pair of relievers to send the game into extra innings.Chicago reliever Zach Stewart (0-1) allowed six runs in the 10th, five unearned.Wieters went deep off Jesse Crain in the eighth to make it 4-2. Nolan Reimold and Adam Jones homered off rookie closer Hector Santiago in the ninth to tie it.''We didn't quit,'' said Jones, who has homered in three of his last four games. ''Once we went to extra innings, we knew that this was our game. I'm still pretty pumped right now.''In the 10th, Mark Reynolds skied a ball to the wall off Stewart that center fielder Alejandro De Aza dropped for a three-base error. Chris Davis doubled off the left-field wall to score the go-ahead run.When I jumped, I jumped too early and took my eyes off of it,'' De Aza said. ''Two bad innings, we just have to keep (our spirits) up and try to win tomorrow.''That opened the door for the Orioles. Reimold added an RBI single.''Any time they come is fine with me,'' Reimold said.With two outs, Wieters hit his first career grand slam into the right-field seats for his fourth homer of the season.Pedro Strop (1-1) picked up the win in relief.A.J. Pierzynski had three hits for Chicago, including a homer down the right-field line against starter Jake Arrieta. He's 4 for 5 against Arrieta in his career.Paul Konerko laced a two-run double in the sixth inning, breaking open a tie game and scoring De Aza and Brent Morel. Konerko has hit safely in all nine games this season.Chicago starter Phil Humber made his season debut and worked out of three jams during his 5 1-3 innings. He was left with a no-decision after throwing 115 pitches, allowing one run, six hits and three walks while striking out seven.Santiago blew his first save in four chances.''The way I look at it is how he bounces back,'' first-year White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. ''I have confidence in him to take him out there and let him do it again tomorrow night.''Arrieta (1-1) was effective during his 6 2-3 innings, but his defense committed three errors behind him. Arrieta allowed four runs - two earned - and struck out seven.''Jake was the difference,'' Showalter said. ''(His outing) will be forgotten, but he was outstanding. It's very encouraging the way he pitched again tonight.''The Orioles left the bases loaded in both the third and fourth innings, then stranded two more in the fifth.Baltimore entered hitting .179 with runners in scoring position and started Monday's game 1 for 9.In the 10th inning alone, Baltimore had five hits with runners in scoring position.''It has kind of a snowball effect,'' Wieters said. ''Once you get some runs going, you stop squeezing the bat as tight and it starts to come a little bit easier.''Wieters committed a pair of throwing errors as the Orioles surrendered a pair of unearned runs.The White Sox have split first four games at U.S. Cellular Field this season after finishing with the American League's second-worst home record last year at 36-45. Chicago has won five of their last six games.The Orioles won their only series in Chicago last season, but wound up winning five road series overall. Baltimore won two of three at Toronto over the weekend.NOTES: Reliever Tsuyoshi Wada will continue his rehab from a left elbow impingement with a rehab outing Thursday for Triple-A Norfolk. Baltimore manager Buck Showalter expects him to be activated later this month. . Reimold was held out of the starting lineup because leg cramps, but pinch hit for Endy Chavez in the seventh. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Are we seeing a new day in Orioles\\u2019 baseball?', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ve written a lot about clutch hitting through the first couple weeks worth of Oriole games; that\xe2\x80\x99s not been done by design, but more so because circumstances have called for it. In last week\xe2\x80\x99s NY series we saw the Orioles cave under pressure and suddenly not be able to hit in the clutch. However since then it seems that they\xe2\x80\x99ve mastered the skill. Let me once again reiterate that nobody succeeds 100% of the time. However in theory nobody fails 100% of the time either; yet tell any Oriole fan over the past couple of seasons that theory!Yesterday I likened the O\xe2\x80\x99s to Bad Boy LeRoy Brown since they were playing on the south side of Chicago. While I\xe2\x80\x99m a huge fan of that song, the reference I should have made was to Marvin Gaye\xe2\x80\x99s Let\xe2\x80\x99s Get it On!; different connotation I know, but that seemed to be the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 attitude in the latter part of last night\xe2\x80\x99s game. Through the first seven innings it seemed that they had reverted to their old form of not being able to produce with runners in scoring position. The game stood at 1-1until the 6th when Chicago put two runs up. We\xe2\x80\x99ve all seen this particular game before, right? The O\xe2\x80\x99s get a quality start from someone like Jake Arrieta (in adverse conditions \xe2\x80\x93 cold temperatures \xe2\x80\x93 at that), only to not step up and score runs behind him. Then when he tires and gives up a couple of runs the game\xe2\x80\x99s over. Sounds like the same story we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen countless times the past couple of seasons\xe2\x80\xa6right? Not so fast\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6Chicago even put another run on the board in the 7th inning, and Matt Wieters hit was came across at the time as a nominal homer in the top of the 8th. Again, the Birds are still done for the night\xe2\x80\xa6right? Again, not so fast\xe2\x80\xa6there\xe2\x80\x99s still a 9th inning to play. Did the events of last September 28th not teach us anything?! Nolan Reimold\xe2\x80\x99s solo homer put the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within one run before Adam Jones came to the plate with two outs. Remember last week against NY when Jones had the bases loaded and struck out, prompting all of this talk about hitting in the clutch? Flash forward again to last night \xe2\x80\x93 Jones hits a homer to tie the game. You don\xe2\x80\x99t get much more clutch than that.Mark Reynolds reached third base on a fielding error in the top of the 10th, and he was doubled home by Chris Davis as the O\xe2\x80\x99s took a 5-4 lead. Davis scored on the heels of Andino and Reimold singles, prompting Buck Showalter to call down to the pen to have Jim Johnson get loose. Again, let\xe2\x80\x99s talk clutch hitting; later in the inning with the bases loaded, Matt Wieters strides to the plate again. We talk so much about how add-on runs are important in baseball; I suppose that a single on Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 part would have sufficed and scored one or two runs however Wieters decided to go out and hit another homer, his first career grand-slam. With the Birds then leading 10-4, Showalter told Johnson to sit down\xe2\x80\xa6no reason to spend another reliever (and the closer at that) in a non-save situation.I think that the Orioles learned something last week when they lost to the Yankees and were criticized for not being able to hit in the clutch. Since then, they did it in Toronto and they did it again last night in Chicago. That, combined with the same never say die\xc2\xa0attitude that we saw from them last September, has propelled the Orioles off to a very decent 6-4 start. We might well look back at this game on the south side of Chicago\xc2\xa0as a key point in time. With the O\xe2\x80\x99s coming off of a loss on Sunday in Toronto after a couple of feel-good wins, history says that they probably would go into a tailspin. Yet that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen. You\xe2\x80\x99re never going to win them all, so let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that. However if the first ten games are any indication, I think these Birds are here for the long haul.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles claim catcher Luis Exposito - tribunedigital ...', '/* Javascript deferred */var addthis_options = ""digg, twitter, facebook, stumbleupon, delicious, friendfeed, buzz, slashdot, reddit, mixx, fark, linkedin, aim, google, myspace, newsvine, technorati, tumblr, typepad, wordpress, more"";var addthis_exclude = ""print"";var addthis_pub     = ""archivedigger"";/* Javascript deferred */Orioles claim catcher Luis ExpositoApril 17, 2012|By Eduardo A. Encina, The Baltimore SunCHICAGO \xe2\x80\x94 \xe2\x80\x93 In need of organizational catching depth, the Orioles claimed catcher Luis Exposito off waivers from the Red Sox, the club announced Tuesday.To make room for Exposito on the club\'s 40-man roster, the Orioles have designated third baseman Josh Bell for assignment.The Orioles signed Taylor Teagarden in the offseason to be Matt Wieters\' backup but he is on the disabled list with back problems. That allowed non-roster invitee Ronny Paulino, who was likely to begin the season at Triple-A, to make the Orioles\' 25-man roster out of camp. Teagarden was slated to visit a back specialist this week in Florida. There\'s still no timetable for his return.""We\'re an injury away from really having some challenges catching-wise,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s something we\'ve identified. We thought we had done it between Ronny and Teagarden. We\'re still not sure where we are physically with Taylor."" var adSkipCounter = 0; ""He\'s got options and he gives us some flexibility and maneuverability with that position,"" Showalter added. ""He\'s had some experience at high levels, and when you watch how the offseason goes with six-year free-agents, those guys just fly off the board. We were lucky to get Ronny and trade for Taylor and it\'s an area we\'ve identified. Who knows? He\'s still a young man. This is not some 28-, 29-year-old journeyman catcher. This is a guy who\'s been thought very high of recently.""As for Bell, once a top prospect in the Dodgers organization, it\'s been a steady fall. Bell, 25, owned a .200/.221/.264 line in 79 games with the Orioles in 2010 and 2011. This spring, he was optioned to Triple-A Norfolk, where he was hitting just .094/.256/.250 in nine games for the Tides.The Orioles acquired Bell and pitcher Steve Johnson in the trade that sent reliever George Sherrill to the Dodgers on July 30, 2009.""Let that process move through,"" Showalter said of Bell. ""He could still be with us and we still like the potential he has. It\'s just the need of our organization for someone like Exposito. That\'s really what it came down to. And I\'m sure there were other people, Dan and the front office considered. It\'s not like we\'re moving on from Josh. We\'re hoping he gets through and that he continues to be someone with some upside for us. We\'ll see how everyone perceives him now.""O\'s minor-league catcher Ohlman suspended 50 gamesA second Orioles minor-league catcher has been suspended for violating the Minor League Drug Prevention and Treatment Progam.Michael Ohlman received a 50-game suspension for his second violation of the drug policy, the office of the commissioner of baseball announced Tuesday. The suspension was for a drug of abuse, which means it was not for use of a performance-enhancing drug.This spring, catcher Brian Ward also received a 50-game suspension.Ohlman\'s suspension will begin immediately, but he is recovering from a shoulder injury sustained during an automobile accident during spring training. He is on the roster at Single-A Delmarva.Because he was from nearby Bradenton, Ohlman joined the Orioles\' big-league spring training camp in Sarasota when non-roster invitee Paulino was held up with visa issues.He was an 11th-round pick for the Orioles out of Lakewood Ranch (Fla.) High School, but received a $995,000 signing bonus that was much higher than the slotted bonus.He is coming off of a season at Delmarva in which he put up a .224/.320/.307 line with four homers and 51 RBIs. He\'s never been above 15th on the Orioles\' Baseball America prospects list.Showalter now worried about slumping reservesTwo of the Orioles top players this spring \xe2\x80\x94 reserves Endy Chavez and Nick Johnson \xe2\x80\x94 have struggled mightily early on.After a 0-for-3 night Monday, Chavez \xe2\x80\x94 who hit .444 this spring \xe2\x80\x94 is 1-for-15 this season. Johnson, who made the team as a non-roster invitee this spring by putting up a .292/.393/.458 line, is hitless in 16 at bats.""I shouldn\'t be surprised,"" Showalter said. ""I\'m not really. It\'s like yesterday I wanted to play them a couple days in a row to get them going, and they will. They\'ve got too much of a track record when they\'re healthy of being good offensive players. It will happen, it just hasn\'t happened in 15 or 16 at bats.""Bundy runs hitless inning streak to nineThe Orioles\' top pitching prospect, right-hander Dylan Bundy, threw three hitless innings Tuesday in his home debut for Class-A Delmarva against Hagerstown.In nine professional innings, Bundy has yet to allow a hit. He struck out three on the night, so he\'s tallied 15 strikeouts in nine innings.Bundy allowed his first baserunner of the season \xe2\x80\x94 27 batters into his pro career \xe2\x80\x94 with a two-out walk in the third inning.The radio broadcast at Delmarva said Bundy hit 102 mph on the radar gun, but the Shorebirds Twitter account said Bundy was clocked at 98.Wieters slam makes history1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

The result was predictable. \xe2\x80\x9cDidn\xe2\x80\x99t have a fastball,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou get hit when you don\xe2\x80\x99t have one. That\xe2\x80\x99s just the bottom line.\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter managed to reach the sixth inning, but gave up eight runs and nine hits in the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 8-1 loss to the Chicago White Sox. A.J. Pierzynski\xc2\xa0and Alejandro De Aza\xc2\xa0homered for the White Sox, who matched a season high with 11 hits. Slumping slugger Adam Dunn hit a three-run double off Troy Patton in Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s four-run sixth. \xe2\x80\x9cTommy kept backing himself into at-bats against people you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to have people on base against,\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore manager Buck Showalter\xc2\xa0said. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was really a killer, because Pierzynski is as hot a hitter as there is in baseball right now.\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter, 25,\xc2\xa0struck out the side in a perfect first inning, but things fell apart fast after that. Pierzynski connected in the second, sending a two-run shot to right that barely cleared the wall and was just inside the foul pole. He also singled in the third and is batting .481 (13 for 27) in his past seven games. Hunter (1-1) matched a career high with eight strikeouts, but walked four. He allowed eight runs for the first time since July 30, 2010, for Texas against the Los Angeles Angels. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve got a couple bullpens coming up, and the emphasis is going to be down in the zone,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI will find (my fastball). It\xe2\x80\x99ll come. Just gotta reach into my back pocket and pick it out. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know where it is or what happened today.\xe2\x80\x9d Hunter left with the bases loaded and two out in the sixth. Dunn then lined a 3-2 pitch from Patton into the left-field corner, putting Chicago up 8-1. Dunn was jeered by the crowd of 13,818 when he swung and missed for his 19th strikeout in the first inning, dropping his average to .175. But the designated hitter walked and scored in the third, walked again in the fifth and put together one of his best plate appearances with the White Sox during Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s four-run sixth. Dunn was 0 for 15 against left-handers this season before the opposite-field hit. Jake Peavy\xc2\xa0pitched seven sparkling innings for the White Sox. Dunn also walked in the ninth and Gordon Beckham hit an RBI single in the sixth to stop a 0-for-14 slump. Endy Chavez had a run-scoring double for the Orioles, who had won four of five. Chavez snapped a 0-for-12 slide with his hit in the second, but that was it for Baltimore. Nolan Reimold went 1 for 4 with a single, ending a string of four consecutive games with a homer. Peavy\xc2\xa0(2-0) allowed four hits, struck out eight and walked none in his longest outing since he pitched eight shutout innings at Minnesota on August 7. Finally healthy again, the right-hander has pitched at least six innings in each of his three outings this year. \xe2\x80\x9cIt starts with Jake and just what he brings, energy-wise and the way he\xe2\x80\x99s been pitching,\xe2\x80\x9d White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe just brings the level up.\xe2\x80\x9d Alex Rios drove in Dunn with a sacrifice fly in the third, making it 3-1, and De Aza added a solo drive to right-center in the fourth for his third homer. NOTES: Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Kosuke\xc2\xa0Fukudome made his first start of the season in left field and his third start overall. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s a good time to get him in there and get him some at-bats,\xe2\x80\x9d Ventura said. Dayan Viciedo\xc2\xa0rested and Ventura said he would be back in the lineup Thursday afternoon. Ventura also said utilityman\xc2\xa0Brent Lillibridge\xc2\xa0could start the finale of the four-game series. \xe2\x80\xa6Nick Markakis\xc2\xa0served as Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s designated hitter and Chavez got the start in right field.

Anyone want to do the math and figure out what the magic number is?! Let\xe2\x80\x99s not get ahead of ourselves; it\xe2\x80\x99s a long season, and it\xe2\x80\x99s very early (especially with the divisional competition that the Orioles have). I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure what the bigger story is from last night; the O\xe2\x80\x99s continuing to win and to come through when it counts, or Wei-Yin Chen getting his first big league win.Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Chen: 5.1 IP, 6 H, 2 R, 2 BB, 4 K. Once he got into the 6th he seemed to start to fall apart in the sense that he tired. However prior to that he was flat out dealing. Chen has a nasty curve ball that he used to freeze hitters on several different occasions. While his fastball isn\xe2\x80\x99t blowing people away with velocity, it\xe2\x80\x99s hitting in the low 90\xe2\x80\x99s and is deadly accurate. To say the least, Chen was a good find by GM Dan Duquette in the off season (at least so far). Ironically, this was Chen\xe2\x80\x99s second consecutive start where wind and cold were an issue. Last week at Camden Yards against NY he started on a cold and windy night; we know he can do that, however I suppose that the real question is can he handle the hot and humid Baltimore summer?Following a Robert Andino single in the top of the 6th, Nolan Reimold hit his third home run in as many games to give the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 2-0 lead. (Just for the sake of clarity, Reimold homered on Saturday in Toronto, sat out Sunday, and homered on Monday and Tuesday in Chicago. That was over four games, however in each game he appeared he homered.) J.J. Hardy immediately followed that with a solo home run of his own to extend the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lead to 3-0. Judging by what the O\xe2\x80\x99s did in Toronto over the weekend and what they\xe2\x80\x99re doing in Chicago this week, it\xe2\x80\x99s fairly obvious that the cold temperatures are affecting how they swing the bat. Yet they\xe2\x80\x99ve still managed to come through when needed to either get on base or put a run on the board with the game on the line.As can often be the case in pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s duels, one team coming to life also awakened the other team. Chicago showed some moxie of their own by putting two across on A.J. Pierzynski\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double. This chased Chen out of the game, and Birdland started to get that sinking feeling based upon experiences from years past in games like these. However reliever Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day picked off Alex Rios at second base to end the inning and strand Pierzynski at third base. Jim Johnson made things a little interesting by allowing some base path traffic in the ninth, however when he got Morel to ground out to end the game the Orioles had their 7th win of the season.As was the case in the two wins in Toronto and the win in Chicago on Monday night, this is a game that the Orioles would have lost last season and before. They might well have scored the first three runs of the game, however when Chicago scored the two runs in the bottom of the inning that would have signaled the end. Whomever came in from the bullpen would have probably tried to hold the runner (Rios), and ended up throwing a wild pitch; Pierzynski would have scored from third and tied the game. I\xe2\x80\x99ll even grant you that the O\xe2\x80\x99s might have gotten out of the inning without further damage. However with the score then tied at three Chicago would have used their last at-bat and probably hit a walk-off home run to end the game. 2012 truly does appear to be a new day. Certainly the fact is that there\xe2\x80\x99s new blood on this team that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t here previously (Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day and Wei-Yin Chen being two examples). However I think there\xe2\x80\x99s also an air of confidence on this team that didn\xe2\x80\x99t exist before now. Granted you have to be careful that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t border on arrogance, however this team believes it can win and that\xe2\x80\x99s a huge part of the battle.This evening Tommy Hunter will go to the mound to face Jake Peavy of the ChiSox. Peavy struck out eight batters in his start last Friday night against the Tigers, so while he\xe2\x80\x99s battled injuries since coming to Chicago he still has his good stuff. This might be the time for Mark Reynolds to take another day off since he seems to have the propensity to strike out here and there and Peavy\xe2\x80\x99s a strikeout pitcher. That aside, these aren\xe2\x80\x99t \xe2\x80\x9cyour Daddy\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles\xe2\x80\x9d in that there appears to be very little that rattles these guys. While the rest of the league is talking about Stephen Strasburg, Bobby Valentine, Kevin Youkilis, etc, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are very quietly having themselves a heck of a road trip. If they can continue that trend, they might just find themselves coming home to Camden Yards still in first place.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

(AP Photo/Charles Rex Arbogast)MoreCHICAGO (AP) The Baltimore Orioles claim to have a different mindset this season and not even a tiny interloper could derail another confidence-building road victory.Jason Hammel struck out 10 and closer Jim Johnson fanned Alex Rios with the bases loaded Thursday to preserve the Orioles' 5-3 win over the Chicago White Sox.''I wasn't trying to make it as dramatic as I did,'' Johnson said. ''It's good to get three out of four here.''The game was briefly delayed in the top of the seventh inning when a young boy who appeared to about 4 or 5 years old slipped through a barricade and went running across the outfield. With the crowd laughing, White Sox left fielder Dayan Viciedo scooped him up and handed him over to a security guard.The child and his family were ejected from the game per Major League Baseball rules but no charges were filed, the team said.''Safety is our No. 1 concern and we are happy that the child is fine,'' White Sox spokesman Scott Reifert said in a statement. ''Obviously it was a non-issue for Dayan who was able to field the kid cleanly.''''But going on the field is stuff we do take seriously. It's not something we condone in any way,'' he said.Adam Jones hit his fifth homer of the season and an RBI double. He's gone deep four times in the first seven games of Baltimore's 10-game road trip. The two-run shot in the fifth was his first this year with a runner on base.The Orioles won three of four from Chicago and have won their first two road series of the season, including two of three at Toronto last weekend. Baltimore won just five road series last season.''A common denominator of teams that are competitive is they play well on the road,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''So far, so good.''Hammel (2-0) matched a career high for strikeouts, doing it in just six innings. He worked out of trouble early, leaving the bases loaded in the first and third.''I made some good pitches,'' Hammel said. ''They're a very aggressive team. They're going swing at bad stuff if you get ahead in the count. I think I exploited that today.''Johnson earned his sixth save. He has converted 14 straight chances dating to last season.Hammel bested Gavin Floyd (1-2), who allowed five runs and six hits in six innings.''Obviously not the results you want,'' Floyd said. ''You want to keep the team in the game a little bit better.''Adam Dunn had a walk, an RBI double and scored for Chicago. He extended his streak of getting on base to six appearances before striking out his next two times up, increasing his AL-high total to 21.Dunn singled with two outs in the ninth, moving pinch-runner Brent Morel to third, and Paul Konerko was hit by a pitch to load the bases. Rios struck out looking to end the game.''It's like you're getting close and it's just not happening,'' White Sox manager Robin Ventura said. ''Eventually, those (rallies) will push through and it will be different.''Jones doubled during a two-run first. In the fifth, after J.J. Hardy's sacrifice fly broke a 2-all tie, Jones hit a full-count fastball from Floyd into the left-field seats.''I'm just doing what I'm supposed to do,'' Jones said. ''Just staying aggressive in the zone, trying to be the best for my team.''Hammel allowed doubles to Alejandro De Aza and Dunn in the third. Rios' single made it 2-all and Alexei Ramirez walked to load the bases. Hammel recovered to strike out Viciedo and Tyler Flowers, preserving the tie.Endy Chavez reached bases three times and scored two runs for the surprising Orioles, who travel to Anaheim for the last stop on their road trip leading the AL East.''We have a good group of guys here,'' Jones said. ''There is a different mindset in here this year. We're not letting up on nobody.''NOTES: The White Sox announced a paid attendance of 11,836.

They\xe2\x80\x99ll be back in Baltimore on Tuesday to face the Blue Jays once again. Will any of you left coast Camden Chatters be on hand for this series?   Biggest story from this past series involved Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 game 1 heroics (2 home runs, including a grand slam in extra innings). He\xe2\x80\x99s pretty good, that one. Other notable performances included Nolan Reimold (2 home runs, although dealing with neck spasms, leg cramps, and other various ailments) and Adam Jones (2 home runs). In other news, Wei-Yin Chen picked up his first MLB win. Solid stuff.    Fairly pedestrian start for the Angels, who are still waiting for some significant bats to get rolling. Those bats shall remain anonymous to avoid jinxing the situation. They\xe2\x80\x99re also having some questionable performances from the bullpen early on. Kendrys Morales is a good story though. Nice to see him hitting the ball rather well in his return to baseball.   Three game set begins tonight at 10:05pm EST. Brian Matusz will be on the hill for the Orioles.

Employs a low-90s fastball, slider, and changeup. Made heavy, heavy use of the sinker in his first outing this season. Likes to go down and in with the slider on lefties, but will stay away with the fastball and changeup. Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t often throw the changeup to right-handed hitters.       Key Stats:   Williams was much better at home last year, with an ERA under 3 (albeit, a very small sample size). Current O\xe2\x80\x99s lineup has limited numbers vs. Williams, but Matt Wieters is 1-3 with a home run. Williams has gone 2-0 vs. the O\xe2\x80\x99s with 2.51 ERA in his career. The Angels have raked off of Matusz, with the exception of Bobby Abreu (0-6, 5Ks). Vernon Wells has a grand slam off of Kevin Gregg.

Utilizes a variety of pitches including a fastball (both four-seam and two-seam), cutter, changeup, slider, and curveball. Not at all overpowering (fastball sits in the upper-80s/low-90s), but locates his pitches well. Reserves the changeup mostly for lefties and the slider for righties. Both pitches are kept away.      Key Stats:   Weaver has decent numbers against the Orioles, although his record hangs at 3-3. No current Oriole has hit Weaver especially well, although Nick Markakis is 5-18 lifetime with a home run and 2 RBI. Weaver has pitched well in April over his career (and also enjoys pitching at Anaheim Stadium). The current Angel lineup is just 3 for 24 against Arrieta, although he has yet to face Albert Pujols.   Game 3 (Sunday @ 3:35pm)   Probable Pitchers:   BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Wei-Yin Chen (LHP, 1-0, 3.27 ERA) LAA \xe2\x80\x93 Dan Haren (RHP, 0-1, 4.76 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Makes heavy use of a cutter and supplements it with a two-seam fastball, curveball, and changeup. Like Weaver, hits about 90 on his fastball. Takes over 10 MPH off of the curveball.   Key Stats:   Only so-so stats versus the Orioles. Nice record at 5-3, but ERA sits up at 4.21. J.J. Hardy is 4-9 with 3 doubles and 4 RBI off of Haren. Matt Wieters is just 1-8 and Nick Markakis 4-20 (although Nicky does have a home run). Over the last three seasons, Haren has a 2.91 ERA in day games. Chen will obviously be making his first start against the Angels.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

But before the Rangers took a healthy lead (it was 9-3 going into the ninth inning when the O's rallied), Brady Anderson got things started with a lead-off home run. 1996 was, of course, the year the Anderson went crazy and hit 50 home runs at the plate, more than twice as many as he hit in any other single season. But what was special about this home run on this night was that it was the fourth consecutive night that he lead off a game with a home run (one game against the Boston Red Sox followed by three against the Texas Rangers). Anderson hit 44 lead-off home runs in his career, and to do it in four consecutive games is pretty spectacular. The last three were on the road, so Anderson gave the team a lead before the Orioles pitcher took the mound. And although 1996 was a good year for the O's, sadly none of Brady's home runs helped them win the game as they went 0-4 in the stretch, which included a very ugly 26-4 loss to the Rangers on April 19th. But not much of that losing streak can be blamed on Anderson, as in the four-game stretch he went 8-for-16 three walks and five home runs. Most of you probably know that Anderson worked with Nolan Reimold when he was struggling after coming back from injury and was in the minors. Did Anderson's help contribute to Reimold's current hot streak at the plate? We'll never know, of course, but if Reimold keeps it up he could become a lead off hitter built in a similar mold to Anderson. He has speed and power, and he also just hit home runs in four consecutive games (although not leading off; Nolan prefers the late-inning heroics). He'll never be the defensive outfielder that Anderson was, but if any Oriole could match Anderson's feat of lead-off home runs in four consecutive games, it's Reimold.

(AP Photo/Mark J. Terrill)MoreANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) The Los Angeles Angels are hoping they'll look at their horrible start as nothing but a bad memory by the time the season ends.Their play Friday night suggests better times ahead.Howie Kendrick had three hits and three RBIs, and the Angels beat Baltimore 6-3 Friday night to end a three-game losing skid and hand Orioles left-hander Brian Matusz his 12th straight loss.''That's big for our team. That's the only way you're going to win ballgames - by driving in runs,'' said Kendrick, one of seven batters in the starting lineup who came in with fewer than five RBIs.''A lot of guys swung the bats well for us tonight, and that's what we have to do all year long,'' Kendrick added. ''We have to be consistent and put together a lot of good at-bats, like we did tonight.''Jerome Williams (1-1) allowed three runs and seven hits in 6 2-3 innings, striking out six and walking one. Jordan Walden converted the first ninth-inning save situation by the Angels this season, walking one of his four batters.The victory pulled the Angels (5-9) within 6 1/2 games of the AL West-leading Texas Rangers, who were rained out in Detroit. The largest deficit the Angels have overcome to win any of their eight division titles was in 2004, when they were six games off the pace on July 21. When they won the World Series in 2002, they were 10 1/2 games out after 20 games (6-14), but were able to capture the wild-card berth.''It ain't how you start, it's how you finish. That's how you've got to look at it,'' right fielder Torii Hunter said. ''For the guys in here who have been around, there's no panic right now. Trust me. We know there's time. I mean, if you got to 50 or 60 games and you're 10 games out, that would bother me.''Matusz (0-3) was charged with six runs - four earned - and eight hits in five-plus innings with three walks and six strikeouts. His streak is the longest by any active major leaguer, and one shy of the Orioles record set by Mike Boddicker between August 1987 and May 1988. Matusz, the fourth overall pick in the 2008 draft, has an 11.64 ERA in 13 starts since his last victory on June 6, 2011, against Oakland.''I made some good pitches tonight, but I also didn't make some pitches when I needed to,'' Matusz said. ''I tried to come inside with the fastball a couple of times, but left it over the middle of the plate and got hurt.''Orioles leadoff batter Nolan Reimold, who sat out Thursday's game because of a stiff neck, extended his hitting streak to 10 games. He was 3 for 5 with a two-run homer in the seventh that chased Williams and sliced the Angels' lead to 6-3.Albert Pujols, mired in the longest season-opening home run drought of his career, was 0 for 4 - including a towering drive to left field that Reimold caught with his back against the fence to end the second inning.Pujols, a three-time NL MVP who left the World Series champion Cardinals to sign a $240 million contract with the Angels, is batting .276 with four RBIs in 14 games and 58 at-bats after averaging 40.5 homers and 120.8 RBIs over his 11 previous big league seasons with St. Louis.Hunter also is having difficulty clearing the fences. This is the longest he's gone into a season without a home run since 2000 with Minnesota, when he finally broke through in his 60th game - he became a regular for the first time the following year.''Don't put 'pressing' in there, because I'm not even trying to hit home runs, first of all. I'm just trying to hit the ball up the middle and get my doubles,'' Hunter said. ''I've tried to change my game a little bit - not swing so hard and try to have better at-bats.''One thing about hitting behind a guy like Albert, you know they're going to walk him a lot and he's going to get on base. So you don't want to get up there and try to hit home runs and try to be Albert Pujols. I'm not him. You can't put all that on your shoulders. Just go out there and do what you do.''Baltimore second baseman Robert Andino made two throwing errors and center fielder Adam Jones committed another on an errant relay throw that allowed Erick Aybar to score behind Chris Iannetta and Alberto Callaspo on Kendrick's two-run double in the sixth. The Orioles have made at least one error in 10 of their last 11 games.NOTES: The Angels selected Matusz in the fourth round of the 2005 draft, but he elected to attend the University of San Diego instead. ...

04/22/2012,"[('Today in Orioles History: Happy Birthday, Jimmy Key ...', "" On April 22, 1961, James Edward Key was born. Jimmy Key was drafted in the third round of the 1982 amateur draft by the Toronto Blue Jays. He spent his entire 15-year career with pitching in the American League East: nine seasons with the Blue Jays, four with the New York Yankees, and two with the Baltimore Orioles.  When Jimmy Key is remembered, he is probably remembered for being a Blue Jay given the amount of time he spent in Toronto, or as a Yankee, given the fact that they're the most storied franchise in the history of storied franchises. But he played a very key (Key! Get it?) role in the Orioles wire-to-wire first place season in 1997, and for that he'll always be remembered fondly by yours truly.  When Key arrived in Baltimore he endeared himself to the fans immediately as the Orioles went 9-2 in games started in April and May, and Key pitched to a 2.30 ERA. He went on to pitch 212 innings in 34 starts in 1997 and while he tailed off performance-wise in the second half, he was still a very solid piece of the rotation and a big reason they were able to become AL East champions.  Key's 1998 was a bit more forgettable, just as the 1998 Orioles were a bit more forgettable than their 1997 counterparts. He spent time in the bullpen in the second half and when the season was over, the 37-year-old retired.     In his career, Key pitched in 470 games with an ERA+ of 122 and he was on three World Series winning teams. Not a bad career at all.  Happy birthday, Jimmy!

In truth, it really hasn\xe2\x80\x99t been that much of a problem until the Birds hit Anaheim. They took two-of-three in Toronto, and three-of-four in Chicago. Now they\xe2\x80\x99re needing a win this afternoon against the L.A. Angels to avoid being swept. One way or another, the O\xe2\x80\x99s are guaranteed at least a .500 road trip (which isn\xe2\x80\x99t too bad). However 6-4 sounds a lot better.For the second consecutive night the Orioles committed three errors in the field. Twice during the game Jake Arrieta threw over to first base only to throw wide of the bag and allow the base runner to go to second. Speaking for myself, I felt that Arrieta became a bit too preoccupied with the base runners. On top of those two errors, Arrieta walked five guys in the game. After stumbling a bit out of the game in the first by keeping the ball up Arrieta settled down fairly well through four innings.Prior to the Angels even coming to bat that inning Matt Wieters seemed to break the game wide open with a two-run homer following Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 infield single. At that point you felt that the Birds seemed to be cruising given that they had a lead in what was looking to be a pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 duel. However in the bottom of the inning Arrieta seemed to come apart from \xe2\x80\x9cbehind the seams.\xe2\x80\x9d Arrieta committed one of his two errors after a Tori Hunter single, and then proceeded to throw a wild pitch to send Hunter to third. When it was all said and done, Arrieta had been chased from the game after giving up 5 runs in 4.1 innings. Lucikily for him and for the team Matt Lindstrom came in and got two outs with the bases loaded on two comebackers to the mound.I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t worry too much about Arrieta. This kind of outing happens to the greatest pitchers of all time here and there; Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s very good at putting stuff in the rearview mirror. What I would be concerned about is Mark Reynolds at third. As I said the O\xe2\x80\x99s committed three errors (for the second consecutive game); Arrieta had two of them\xe2\x80\xa6guess who\xe2\x80\x99s responsible for the third? On two separate occasions Reynolds sailed a throw on a routine grounder wide of the bag at first base. The first time Chris Davis was able to field the ball and still touch the bag for the out. The second time he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t so lucky, and Reynolds was charged with an error. You really can never know what the issue is in a situation like this, however the fact is that Reynolds seems to have regressed defensively from last year. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt in my mind that part of it is mental in that he\xe2\x80\x99s afraid he\xe2\x80\x99s going to make a mistake. However as a professional athlete you can\xe2\x80\x99t allow that to creep into your mind.The O\xe2\x80\x99s did use utility infielder Ryan Flaherty at third for one inning a couple of weeks ago against Minnesota. I for one wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t mind seeing more of Flaherty, and I think that Buck Showalter and Dan Duquette need to see what they have in this kid. Quite honestly I\xe2\x80\x99m a bit disappointed that aside from that appearance and a start last week in Toronto (at first base), Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s been buried on the bench. Am I saying that I\xe2\x80\x99m hoping to see Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s name penciled in at third when the lineup comes out today? Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying. It would serve two purposes in that it would give Flaherty more game experience, and Reynolds would get a day to clear his mind a bit (plus tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s off day).If bad things do in fact happen in three\xe2\x80\x99s, the Orioles have typified that idea the past two games with the three errors in each. Yet they have to hope that the third time is the charm against the Angels in this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s series finale. Wei-Yin Chen will go to the hill for his third big league start, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Dan Harren of the Angels. Aside from the Reynolds/Flaherty dynamic at third, I\xe2\x80\x99ll also be interested to see if Showalter starts Matt Wieters or Ronnie Paulino behind the plate. Many starting catchers get Sundays off (day game after a night game), however with Chen still being a rookie you have to wonder if they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want him to work with his normal battery mate.The O\xe2\x80\x99s seem to have been lost a bit in the shuffle over the weekend in Anaheim after shooting out of the gate on their current road trip. For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, manager Buck Showalter has made a few veiled comments to the effect that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t really pleased with the schedule-makers in sending the Orioles on a ten-game swing all over the map. To this point they\xe2\x80\x99ve handled it well in that they won the first two series\xe2\x80\x99. While the first two Angel games were disappointing, a win this afternoon would send them home on that same sweet note on which they started. A loss would be sobering, however there\xe2\x80\x99s still been a lot of good on this trip.

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)MoreANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) For Baltimore Orioles manager Buck Showalter, the best seat in the house was right in front of the television in the visiting clubhouse.Nick Markakis hit a two-run single in the eighth inning and a run-scoring single in the 10th to help the Orioles beat the Los Angeles Angels 3-2 on Sunday, after Showalter was ejected in the sixth for arguing balls and strikes.''Those were big hits by Nicky with a lot of adversity there,'' Showalter said. ''I mean, I could feel the players' and the team's anxiety by what was going on out on the field. It shows we can certainly win without me around.''Angels right-hander Dan Haren threw 73 of his 115 pitches for strikes, several of which didn't sit well with Showalter, who was run by umpire Angel Campos after Markakis fell behind 0-1 in the count. Markakis eventually was called out on strikes to end the sixth.''That was a fastball down and in, and it got a lot of the plate,'' Haren said. ''(Showalter) was upset about the first pitch, but it caught the corner away. I heard him chirping from the dugout, and I knew he was going to get tossed when he came out.''Showalter's ejection was the 20th of his career and first this season.''When you share your players' frustration, you can feel it in the dugout,'' Showalter said after the Orioles avoided a three-game sweep. ''I mean, there was so much focus on the strike zone, it was taking away from the competition. And when you have the number of people we had complaining that don't ever complain, sometimes you have to take that bullet.''Angels reliever LaTroy Hawkins (0-1) came on in the 10th and immediately walked to No. 9 hitter Robert Andino, who advanced on a sacrifice by Endy Chavez and a groundout by J.J. Hardy. Markakis then grounded a hard single up the middle that deflected off the glove of second baseman Howie Kendrick and into center field.''I feel like I'm comfortable at the plate, but things just weren't coming,'' Markakis said. ''But it's a long season and it's still early. So you've just got to go out there with the same attitude and don't let things bother you, whatever it is. And if you do that, this game will reward you.''Pedro Strop (2-1) pitched two innings for the win despite allowing a tying solo homer in the eighth by Kendrick. Jim Johnson got three outs for his seventh save.Haren was charged with two runs and six hits over 7 1-3 innings and struck out eight in his fourth start. The three-time All-Star, still looking for his first victory, took a 1-0 lead into the eighth before giving up one-out singles by pinch-hitter Matt Wieters and Andino.Chavez greeted lefty Scott Downs with a bloop single on an 0-2 pitch, loading the bases, before Downs turned Hardy's comebacker into a force at the plate. But the left-hander fell behind Markakis 2-0 and Markakis put the Orioles ahead 2-1 with a two-run single through the left side of the infield - his first two RBIs in a span of 37 at-bats.''Nick's been sick as a dog the last two days,'' Showalter said. ''During BP yesterday, I was an eraser away from changing the lineup - and I'm sure he didn't feel a whole lot better today. He wouldn't let us take his temperature, hardly, and he's been scuffling. A lot of guys would have bailed, but that's Nick Markakis. He'd be in there whether or not he played for an organization that Cal Ripken played for.''Kendrick pulled the Angels even in the bottom half with his one-out opposite-field homer to right, the first by the Angels in a span of 42 innings and just their second home run in 58 innings. It also ended a string of 36 straight homerless innings by Baltimore pitchers.Wei-Yin Chen held the Angels to a run and five hits over 6 1-3 innings and struck out five in his third major league start. The Taiwanese left-hander was lifted by bench coach John Russell after giving up a pair of one-out walks.''We're still learning about him,'' Showalter said. ''Today the command was the thing. And quite frankly, he didn't get the benefit of a lot of borderline calls like Haren was getting, but he worked his way through that. When you're facing a guy like Haren with the strike zone that he's working with, you're going to have to be really good. And he was.''Albert Pujols was 0 for 4 with two strikeouts and remained homerless in his 16 games and 65 at-bats, the longest drought from the start of a season in his 12-year career. He started as the designated hitter for the first time since joining the Angels.NOTES: Pujols is 18 for 54 with four homers and 12 RBIs in 13 career games as a DH, including 12 interleague contests with the St. Louis Cardinals. ...

Willis, 30, was signed to a minor league contract by the Orioles in the spring after being released by the Philadelphia Phillies.

But on Sunday, Willis was placed on the minor-league restricted list.The Orioles signed Willis, the 2003 NL Rookie of the Year and 2005 NL Cy Young Award runner-up with the Marlins, to a minor-league deal to be a left-handed relief specialist, but at Norfolk Willis wanted the opportunity to start. var adSkipCounter = 0; That\xe2\x80\x99s where the rift between Willis and the Orioles began, but definitely not where it ends.\xe2\x80\x9cIf Dan is willing to throw one of his own employees under the bus and not support somebody internally and it\xe2\x80\x99s over a player like Dontrelle Willis,\xe2\x80\x9d Sosnick said, \xe2\x80\x9cwho not only was given his release from the team, but is a minor league guy with half a year\xe2\x80\x99s worth of time in the last five years who only wants to start, can you imagine how he behaves with someone who can make a difference for him.\xe2\x80\x9dWhen asked whether the Orioles plan on sticking to their stance and not releasing Willis, Duquette said, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean sticking with our stand? The guy didn\xe2\x80\x99t show up for work.

The margin of victory was provided by  a Matt Wieters homerun that was inadvertently deflected into the stands  by Jays left fielder Eric Thames. Starter Tommy Hunter and a  Jim-Johnson-less bullpen took it the rest of the way to notch the Birds\'  10th win.You  know, Tommy Hunter is sort of an odd breed. He keeps getting raves from  his manager and his teammates that he\'s a ""bulldog"" and a leader and a  fighter...but then you watch him pitch and you kind of wonder how he  ever gets anyone out. Tonight was one of those games. Hunter seemed to  be living dangerously high in the strike zone for most of the night, but  the Jays rarely took advantage. Even in the first inning, Hunter had  trouble putting batters away-- he retired the side in order, but needed  20 pitches to do so. He threw 18 more in a scoreless second.The  Orioles grabbed a first-inning lead, though it ended up being kind of a  wasted opportunity. The first three batters of the game reached base  against Blue Jays starter Henderson Alvarez, loading the bases with  nobody out. But Adam Jones, on a 2-0 count, hacked at a slider and  bounced it to short for a 6-4-3 double play. A run scored, but a chance  for a bigger rally was essentially snuffed. The O\'s never again put more  than one runner on base in an inning.Back  to Hunter, who was burned by one of his hanging pitches in the third.  Eric Thames absolutely demolished a homerun to right field, parking it  onto Eutaw Street for the 58th such blast in Camden Yards history. It  was the seventh homerun allowed by Hunter in just four starts this  season, and his fifth surrendered to the Blue Jays. At least all have  been solo shots. An  inning later, Thames again played a prominent role in a homerun--  except he wasn\'t the guy hitting it. With one out, Matt Wieters swatted a  deep fly to left field. Thames, on his horse, raced back to the wall  and timed his leap to attempt a stupendous catch...except that the ball  glanced off his glove as he jumped and deflected into the seats for a  homerun. Had Thames not touched the ball, it likely would\'ve bounced off  the top of the wall and stayed in play. Thank you very much, Eric  Thames! I\'m so appreciative for your efforts, I\'ll stop calling you  ""Marcus.""And...that\'s  it for the runs tonight. The Orioles had a 2-1 lead, and the game would  ultimately end by that score. For that, we can thank an excellent  effort by five Orioles pitchers. Hunter continued to battle his way  through one scoreless inning after another, issuing a couple of walks in  his final two innings but escaping unscathed. He delivered a quality  start when all was said and done, allowing just one run in six innings  while throwing 103 pitches, even though he didn\'t have great command.  Let the superlatives flow. He\'s gritty! Gutty! Gutsy! Gritsy!The  Orioles were without the services of closer Jim Johnson tonight, as he  was hospitalized with the flu. Happily, the rest of the bullpen picked  up the slack tonight. Lefty Troy Patton got two outs in the seventh, and  Darren O\'Day retired the only batter he faced, Jeff Mathis (talk about  an easy assignment). Luis Ayala tossed a scoreless eighth, working past a  two-out single.With  Johnson out, Orioles fans wondered who would get the chance to close  out the game in the ninth. Kevin Gregg was quickly dismissed as a  possibility, because Buck Showalter doesn\'t hate us. The two candidates  were Matt Lindstrom-- who has previous closing experience with a few  clubs-- and top setup man Pedro Strop. In the ninth, we got our answer:  Strop jogged in from the bullpen for his first career save opportunity.  And he nailed it down without too much trouble. He began the inning with  a strikeout of Adam Lind, and-- after a one-out walk-- he rebounded to  retire the last two hitters, punctuated by a game-ending strikeout of  Thames. Well done, Pedro! His first career save capped nine innings of  one-run, five-hit ball by Orioles pitchers. It almost never comes this  easily, but we\'ll gladly take it.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
04/25/2012,"[('Blue Jays-Orioles Preview - yahoo.com', 'While the Baltimore Orioles haven\'t posted a winning record against the Toronto Blue Jays over any of the previous seven seasons, they could be well on their way to ending that trend.The Orioles try for a fourth victory in five meetings with the Blue Jays as the teams continue a three-game set Wednesday night at Camden Yards.Since taking 11 of 19 from Toronto (10-7) in 2004, Baltimore entered this year a combined 49-79 in the series - including a 6-12 record in 2011.The Orioles (10-7), however, have surprisingly had the Blue Jays number thus far. After taking two of three at Rogers Centre from April 13-15, Baltimore picked up right where it left off during Tuesday\'s 2-1 victory.Matt Wieters put his team up for good with a fourth-inning homer - his team-best sixth, and Tommy Hunter threw six innings of one-run ball before handing it over to what\'s emerging to be one of the best bullpens in baseball.Orioles relievers rank top five in the majors with a 2.14 ERA and have surrendered just two earned runs over an eight-game stretch spanning 25 2-3 innings.""Those guys came in and it was quick and it was effective and they got the job done,"" Hunter said. ""Tip your cap to those guys. They\'ve been good all year and hopefully they continue to do it.""Acquired via trade from Colorado during the offseason, Jason Hammel (2-0, 2.37 ERA) has certainly been a welcome addition to the Orioles\' rotation. The right-hander was terrific during Thursday\'s 5-3 road win over the Chicago White Sox, surrendering two runs, six hits and striking out a career high-tying 10 over six frames.""The first two innings I threw way too many pitches - first three, I guess - but way too many pitches early,"" he told MLB.com. ""I\'ve got to do a better job to get deep in the ballgame. Six innings is OK, but I want seven, eight innings.""Hammel, who gave up a pair of runs over five innings but didn\'t factor in the decision of a 6-4 win at Toronto on April 14, has gone 3-0 with a 3.55 ERA over six career starts against the Blue Jays.Jose Bautista, Adam Lind and Edwin Encarnacion are a combined 3 for 17 off Hammel. Kelly Johnson, meanwhile, is 6 for 17 with a homer.Hammel will be opposed by Kyle Drabek (2-0, 2.00), who after winning his first two home starts, proved a bit shaky during Friday\'s 4-3 victory at Kansas City. The 24-year-old right-hander didn\'t receive a decision after allowing two runs, four hits and issuing a career worst-tying six walks over 5 1-3 frames.""He battled his command, overall, but never gave in,"" manager John Farrell said of Drabek, who surrendered 52 free passes over 14 starts spanning 72 2-3 innings last season.Drabek, in contrast, hit his spots during the Blue Jays\' only win against Baltimore this season, giving up two runs - one earned - and six hits over a career-best 7 1-3 innings of a 9-2 victory April 15.It\'s unknown if Drabek will have to worry about facing Nolan Reimold, who\'s missed the last three games due to neck spasms. Reimold is batting .405 with five homers - two of which have come against Toronto - during a 10-game hitting streak.Orioles closer Jim Johnson\'s availability is also in question after sitting out Tuesday with the flu.

Encina | The Baltimore SunAcross baseball circles, the Orioles\' acquisition of right-hander Jason Hammel was seen as pre-spring training snoozer. But over his first four starts in a Baltimore uniform, Hammel has made the majors take notice. Hammel -- who came to Baltimore with a career 4.99 ERA as part of the trade that sent No. 1 starter Jeremy Guthrie to the Colorado Rockies on Feb. 6 -- has shown to be a much different pitcher so far as an Oriole. He continued his sparkling start Wednesday night, throwing seven shutout innings against a Toronto Blue Jays lineup that has scored the fourth-most runs in the American League. The 29-year-old right hander danced mid-90s two-seam fastballs through the strike zone and missed Toronto bats all night, leading the Orioles to a 3-0 shutout win in front of an announced 10,415 at Camden Yards, the smallest crowd since the 2010 season. var adSkipCounter = 0;  With the win, their first shutout victory since Sept. 9, the Orioles (11-7) held on to a share of first place in the AL East, knocking Toronto (10-8) down a notch with their third straight win and fourth win over the Jays in five games this season. The Orioles sealed their second series win season over Toronto this season, the first time they\'ve done that since 2009. Hammel, who ran his career mark against Toronto to 4-0, bedeviled the Jays by holding them to four hits over seven innings and lowering his season ERA to 1.73. Hammel struck out seven and walked just one, and has 17 strikeouts in his past 13 innings. In each of his four starts this season, he has allowed two runs or fewer. ""I\'ve worked hard on my delivery to make sure I can repeat a pitch,"" said Hammel (3-0). ""Every time you throw a pitch, it should look the same, just a different finger placement, obviously, for the pitches. If you can make everything look the same, you are going to get a lot of swings -- four-seam, two-seam, slider, all should be coming off the same plane. I think we are doing that really well right now."" Hammel has been dazzling at home. In his first home start as an Oriole in the third game of the season, Hammel took a no-hit bid into the eighth inning against the Minnesota Twins. In two home starts, Hammel has allowed just one run in 15 innings for a 0.60 ERA. ""He doesn\'t get too far ahead of himself,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""It\'s kind of like being on the 16th hole and thinking about the 17th and 18th hole. He\'s dwelling on what he\'s playing. If something happens that means he\'s got to face another hitter, he goes and gets it. I was hoping to get five or six [innings] out of him, and all of a sudden he got into the seventh inning for us, which really shortened the workload in the \'pen."" Orioles right-handed reliever Matt Lindstrom, the other player the Orioles acquired in the Guthrie trade, threw a perfect eighth inning but gave the kudos to his fellow former Rockie. ""When we came over together, I knew what kind of pitcher the Orioles were getting in him,"" Lindstrom said. ""He\'s mixing his pitches well, and what I\'m also seeing is Jason mixing in his two-seam fastball and utilizing it a lot more in counts where hitters think they\'re getting a four-seamer, and it\'s devastating. I\'m his catch partner every day, so I think we\'re helping each other every day."" The Orioles hit a pair of solo homers off tough-luck Blue Jays starter Kyle Drabek -- Wilson Betemit\'s shot to straight-away center in the second and Chris Davis\' opposite-field bomb to left in the fourth -- and have a major league leading 18 solo homers, but with Hammel on the mound, it was all they would need. Hammel kept the Blue Jays in check most of the night -- striking out the side in the third inning and not allowing a fly-ball out until the sixth. He survived a 32-pitch fourth inning -- which included a questionable call at first with two outs that loaded the bases -- while clinging to a one-run lead, striking out Toronto center fielder Colby Rasmus swinging to end the inning. In the bottom half of the inning, Davis hit his second homer of the season, crushing an offering from Drabek (2-1) the opposite way about eight rows into the left-field stands. Betemit, who committed errors at third base in each of the first two innings, atoned for his fielding miscues with a third-inning homer, his second home run of the season. After Hammel walked off the field to an ovation after the seventh inning -- having thrown 105 pitches -- Lindstrom brought his high-90s fastball into the eighth and retired the side in order, including swinging strikeouts of Yunel Escobar and Jose Bautista. The Orioles added an insurance run in the eighth on Adam Jones\' two-out RBI double off Jason Frasor, which scored Nick Markakis, who had walked. For the second straight night, Pedro Strop pitched the ninth -- closer Jim Johnson remained hospitalized with flu symptoms and an infection -- and brought the tying run to the plate before inducing a 6-4-3 double play from Brett Lawrie to earn his second career big league save and keep the Orioles atop the division. ""I think it\'s a little bit of everything,"" Davis said of the Orioles\' start. ""Obviously, our pitching\'s been outstanding lately, the bullpen\'s been great, we\'ve been getting hits when we really need it. We\'ve been playing really good defense. We\'re not trying to go out there and reinvent the wheel.

Baltimore won 5-2. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) The Baltimore Orioles are suddenly making a habit of coming through in the clutch and winning the kind of games they used to lose with regularity.Adam Jones led off the eighth inning with a tiebreaking homer and the Orioles beat the Toronto Blue Jays 5-2 on Thursday night, completing a three-game sweep with their fourth straight victory.Jones ripped the first pitch from Casey Janssen (1-1) into the first row of the left-field stands, barely eluding the leap of Eric Thames. It was his sixth homer of the season.Asked if he enjoyed a flair for the dramatic, Jones said: ''If the situation calls for it, I'm not going to shy away from it. ... I'm just looking for something out over the plate. Not necessarily a first-pitch slider away, but I was looking for a heater up, something to drive. I was able to just get enough of it to hit it out.''Darren Oliver replaced Janssen after Jones' drive and allowed Matt Wieters' single before Chris Davis hit a two-run homer to right-center.Darren O'Day (2-0) pitched two perfect innings in relief of Brian Matusz, who might have saved his spot in the rotation with a strong outing. Luis Ayala worked the ninth for his first save.''I just wish we could have got (Matusz) a W. ... But we won as a team and he understands that,'' Jones said. ''He went out and threw six very, very, very good innings.''Matusz, attempting to snap a career-high 12-game losing streak, yielded two runs - none earned - and four hits. He walked two and fanned three.''This year, I've felt good out there in multiple outings,'' Matusz said. ''Just today I was able to be consistent and really find myself getting into a groove and putting everything together, and I'm just not trying to do too much but being able to hit locations and make good pitches.''Orioles manager Buck Showalter didn't sound as though he was considering a change in the rotation.''He pitches like that, he's going to get all the wins he wants,'' Showalter said.The Blue Jays have lost three straight and are 1-5 against the Orioles this season.''We've got to play better collectively,'' Toronto manager John Farrell said. ''The way this road trip started out, with a four-game sweep in Kansas City, to have it end this way kind of leaves a bad taste.''Toronto scored three runs in three defeats at Camden Yards and Jose Bautista said the Blue Jays' offense has to produce more - and more consistently.''I'm not really worried about the offense,'' Bautista said. ''I know we're going to pick it up. Hopefully, it's sooner rather than later. Our pitching is doing awesome. On the offensive side, we'd like to give them better support.''Baltimore's Ryan Flaherty had two hits and an RBI, the firsts of his major league career.Drew Hutchison, making his second major league start, held the Orioles to two hits through four innings before Baltimore went ahead 1-0 in the fifth.Davis worked the right-hander for a leadoff walk and Mark Reynolds lined a single to center. Davis moved to third on Nick Johnson's fly to right and Flaherty hit a sacrifice fly.Toronto went ahead in the sixth on an error by Johnson at first base that allowed two runs to score.Yunel Escobar led off with a single and Bautista drew a one-out walk. One out later, Thames hit a 1-2 pitch from Matusz down the first base line and past Johnson, who missed an attempt to backhand the bouncer, the miscue letting both runners score.The Orioles tied the game in the sixth, taking advantage of Escobar's error at shortstop.Nick Markakis doubled and Jones hit a grounder into the hole. Escobar fielded the infield hit but threw wildly to first, allowing Markakis to score the tying run and Jones to advance to second. Luis Perez relieved and got Wieters to ground into a fielder's choice, with Jones erased at third.Hutchison worked five-plus innings, allowing two runs and six hits.NOTES: Matusz wasn't charged with a run for the first time since Sept. 27, 2010. ... Baltimore's Nolan Reimold singled in the fifth, extending his hitting streak to 11 games. He returned after sitting out four games with neck spasms. ... Showalter said RHP Jim Johnson, who has been hospitalized for treatment of a bacterial infection, could be released as soon as Friday morning.

Darren has been pretty solid. And that\'s what Luis does. We\'ve got some bullets down there and we\'re able to use them kind of shuffled around.\xe2\x80\x9dIt\xe2\x80\x99s helped considerably\xc2\xa0that the Orioles starters have gone deep into the game so far this season. They have given the team 11 starts of six or more innings and the Orioles are 10-1 in those games.

""It was pretty bad.""Doctors conducted various tests to rule out specific illnesses, and eventually, food poisoning \xe2\x80\x94 including when and where \xe2\x80\x94 was pinpointed. He was back in the clubhouse Friday, worked out a little and played catch.""I\'m just kind of lethargic, I guess, right now,"" said Johnson, who wasn\'t sure when he would next pitch. ""I\'ve been laying on my back for four days. Just getting on my feet, running around, doing some cardio stuff was good."" var adSkipCounter = 0; Johnson might not have had his full strength Friday, but the food poisoning didn\'t sap his wry wit. He cautioned reporters to clean their microphones after the interview. He said he had to have a talk with the hospital president because they didn\'t have the MASN feed on the facility\'s TVs so he had to watch the Major League Baseball gamecast on his iPad.""I watched the pitch-by-pitch thing. Their strike-zone analysis is pretty interesting,"" he quipped.The huge New York Rangers fan also said he kept himself busy watching playoff hockey and the NFL draft when he felt up to it.""I could only get the French version of the Rangers game,"" Johnson said. ""They still won in French. And it still all sounds the same.""When Johnson was finally released, he texted his manager, Buck Showalter: ""I don\'t know who put the bail up for me, but I appreciate it, whoever it was.""Showalter wouldn\'t rule out Johnson for Friday\'s game \xe2\x80\x94 though he wasn\'t expected to pitch \xe2\x80\x94 but said the biggest challenge would be to slow Johnson down and ease him back into a game situation. More than anything, Showalter said, everyone\'s just glad the problem was diagnosed.""First thing that goes through your mind is health, period,"" Showalter said, ""when you have that much time trying to identify something. [But] they finally identified it. As soon as they identified it, it moved pretty quickly.""While Johnson was unavailable, the Orioles\' bullpen held its own. Relievers converted all three save opportunities, with Pedro Strop getting two and Luis Ayala saving one.""I [suspected] that we would be able to handle it,"" Showalter said. ""I think we are a better club with Jimmy here, and we\'re glad to have him back, but everybody stepped up and I was proud of them.""Nick Johnson\'s O\'s infamyBy going 0-for-3 Thursday, infielder Nick Johnson set the club record for hitless at-bats by a position player to start an Orioles career with 26 \xe2\x80\x94 eclipsing infielder Ron Hansen\'s skid from 1958 to 1960.The all-time record for modern-day Orioles \xe2\x80\x94 since 1954 \xe2\x80\x94 is reliever Wes Stock, who was hitless in 36 at-bats (with two walks and 26 strikeouts) Stock was traded to the Kansas City Athletics in June 1964 for catcher Charlie Lau and had three hits for the A\'s that season.Johnson didn\'t play in 2011, so his hitless streak actually goes back to 2010, when he was hitless in the final two at-bats. Johnson\'s last hit came May 5, 2010, in Yankee Stadium as a New York Yankee. He had three hits that day against the Orioles.His last hit was a single against Alfredo Simon in the eighth inning of that game. Johnson also homered against Orioles starter David Hernandez, doubled against reliever Mark Hendrickson and walked twice, reaching base in all five plate appearances in the Yankees\' 7-5 win.Only nine Orioles since 1954 have had at least 10 at-bats and never gotten a hit in their Orioles career. Counting Johnson, who likely will break the skid at some point, only three were position players: catcher Tim Laker (14 hitless at-bats in 1997) and outfielder Carl Warwick (14 hitless at-bats in 1965).The rest were pitchers: Stock (36 hitless at-bats from 1959 to 1964), Harvey Haddix (21, 1964-1965), Charlie Beamon (17, 1956-1958), Art Ceccarelli (14, 1957), Daniel Cabrera (14, 2004-2008) and Rodrigo Lopez (11, 2002-2006).Andino back; Berken downSecond baseman Robert Andino, who was away from the club for two days for the birth of his daughter, was removed from the paternity list Friday and was in the starting lineup.Pitcher Jason Berken, who replaced Andino on the roster but did not pitch, was sent back to Triple-A Norfolk. Berken, 28, has pitched to a 0.60 ERA (15 innings, one earned run) with four walks and 10 strikeouts in three starts for the Tides this season.Britton throws off moundZach Britton threw off a mound in Sarasota, Fla., for the first time Friday since receiving an injection in his ailing shoulder in March. Showalter wouldn\'t reveal a timeline for the lefty\'s return to the Orioles but said Britton remains on the rehabilitation schedule that the team outlined for him.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) The Oakland Athletics had only five hits Friday night. Thanks to Brandon McCarthy's solid pitching, that was enough.As a result, the Athletics are a game over .500 for the first time since May 18, 2011.McCarthy won for the first time this season, pitching seven strong innings, and Eric Sogard hit a two-run home run in a three-run second as Oakland beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-2 on Friday.The Athletics have won three straight for the second time this season.''We did maximize our offense today with the number of hits we got and that's the type of team we need to be,'' Oakland manager Bob Melvin said.In McCarthy's first five starts, the Athletics scored 10 runs.''Any time we can go out and get a few early and then hopefully the pitcher settles in and does his job, the game moves faster and kind of puts you in a positive mind set early,'' McCarthy said.McCarthy (1-3) gave up two runs and five hits, walked three and struck out four.Ryan Cook struck out four Orioles in the eighth inning, with Adam Jones reaching on a wild pitch.''I didn't realize,'' Cook said. ''It's not something that's ever your goal when you go out there.''Sogard, who was starting because Luke Hughes was a late scratch with an illness, didn't realize he had witnessed a baseball rarity.''No, but he did, didn't he? That is awesome,'' Sogard said.''McCarthy pitched an unbelievable game. A shaky start with the one run, but shut them down after that.''Grant Balfour worked the ninth for his sixth save in seven chances.Jake Arrieta (1-2) allowed four runs on four hits in 5 2-3 for Baltimore, which had a four-game winning streak snapped and failed to go six games over .500 for the first time since July 20, 2005.''We didn't do much off McCarthy. I think that was a big part of it,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.The Orioles took a 1-0 lead when Nolan Reimold led off the first with a double to increase his hitting streak to 12 games. He scored on a sacrifice fly by Nick Markakis.Oakland took a 3-1 lead in the top of the second off Arrieta. Kila Ka'aihue walked with one out, and scored on a two-out double by Kurt Suzuki. Sogard hit a home run to right field - his second.It was his fourth in 43 major league games.''He has a way of sneaking them down the line. We've seen him do it before, but we don't count on him being a home run guy and drive in runs,'' Melvin said.In the sixth, Josh Reddick homered to right for the Athletics - his third of the year - to make it 4-1. It was his sixth home run in 24 games against the Orioles. Reddick added an RBI single in the eighth.Before the home run, Arrieta (1-2) had retired nine straight.Baltimore scored a run in the sixth on a double by J.J. Hardy and an RBI single by Jones. He's 4 for 11 against McCarthy.''That's the key around baseball, throwing strike one. Successful pitchers do that and tonight he was throwing strike one and made us put the ball in play,'' Jones said.NOTES: Athletics OF Coco Crisp stole his 26th consecutive base in the eighth inning. ... Orioles RHP Jim Johnson returned to the team after spending four nights at a local hospital because of food poisoning. ... Baltimore reinstated INF Robert Andino from the paternity list and optioned RHP Jason Berken to Triple-A Norfolk. ... Home plate umpire Jeff Kellogg tackled a fan who ran onto the field during the seventh inning stretch and eluded police. When the fan slid into home plate, Kellogg pounced on him. ...

"", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 10, Athletics 1: Chen and Davis make some Orioles ...', "" My apologies if you've been sitting home on this Saturday night eagerly awaiting the recap of this exciting game between the Baltimore Orioles and Oakland Athletics. It's going up a little bit later than usual because I had the privilege of attending tonight's game with several of the Camden Chat front-page writing staff. It was a fun game with good friends and a just little rain. I was excited to see Wei-Yin Chen pitch in person tonight, but he didn't get off to a great start. He walked the first batter he faced, Jemile Weeks, and loaded the bases thanks to a single and another walk. He worked out of it without allowing a run, but he threw twenty-seven pitches and it felt like it might be the beginning of  rough night for Chen. We were wondering in the stands who the long man might be since Troy Patton pitched multiple innings last night. Turns out we didn't need to worry about that. Just as has happened to Chen in some of his other starts, he got his act together. He pitched through the fifth inning without trouble, and then in the sixth inning gave up his only run on the night, a homer to Johnny Gomes. And he didn't tire early tonight, pitching seven total innings of one-run baseball. Great night for Chen! He ended with the final line of 7 IP, 6 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 4 K. There aren't many nights that the offense is going out outshine a game in which the starter pitches seven good innings, but tonight might be one of them. After going down 1-2-3 on just eight pitches in the first inning, the Orioles jumped all over A's starter Tyson Ross in the second. They sent nine batters to the plate in the inning, and six of the first seven batters singled, leading to four runs. The fifth scored when J.J. Hardy hit a sacrifice fly for the second out of the inning. It gave a pretty good cushion to Chen, though he really didn't need all of those runs.    The Orioles added another run in the second inning when Wilson Betemit doubled in Adam Jones, and three more in the fifth inning courtesy of RBI singles from Jones and Chris Davis. Their final run of the game was on a home run by Chris Davis, a no-doubt bomb (as long as it stayed fair) that landed on Eutaw Street in the seventh inning. By that time it seemed like the O's were just piling on, because no one believed that the A's were capable of scoring enough runs to even make it a respectable game. Luis Ayala relieved Chen in the eighth inning and finished the game, allowing just one hit. So in a game that looked like the starter might not have it, they ended up only needing one relief pitcher. Not bad at all. Tomorrow the Orioles will try to win the series as they send Tommy Hunter out to face Bartolo Colon.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

The Orioles won 5-2. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) The unlikely comeback began rather innocently, with a pair of hits that didn't make it out of the infield.Then came two drives off the outfield wall, providing the Baltimore Orioles with an exclamation point on a successful homestand and a wave of momentum heading into Yankee Stadium.Wilson Betemit hit a three-run homer in the bottom of the ninth inning after Matt Wieters doubled in two runs, and Baltimore rallied to a 5-2 victory over the Oakland Athletics on Sunday.''We got a team where everybody pulls together,'' Betemit said in the jubilant Orioles clubhouse. ''Everybody knows how to play, knows how to win, and that's what we do.''The victory concluded a 5-1 homestand. Next up for Baltimore: A three-game series against the Yankees, who swept Baltimore at Camden Yards earlier this month.''It's nice to finish on that note,'' Wieters said. ''We'll enjoy it for the rest of the day and then move on to play the Yankees.''Oakland starter Bartolo Colon took a four-hit shutout into the ninth without allowing a runner past second base.After J.J. Hardy led off with an infield hit and Nick Markakis struck out, Adam Jones hit a chopper down the third-base line that Colon collected before throwing wildly to first. The single and error put runners at second and third and ended Colon's afternoon.''In fairness to Bartolo, he pitched great,'' Oakland manager Bob Melvin said. ''Even in the last inning he gives up a ground ball and then a swinging bunt. ... It certainly wasn't his fault.''Grant Balfour (0-1) entered and promptly gave up a double to left by Wieters that bounced off the wall in left-center.''It wasn't like I left it up, but I left it up enough (for Wieters) to get a good swing on it,'' Balfour said.After Chris Davis received an intentional walk, Betemit drove a 3-1 pitch to right-center that bounced off the top of the wall - a home run, according to the ground rules at Camden Yards.''I don't know the ball is gone,'' Betemit said of his first career walk-off homer. ''I just hit the ball, and I tried to put it in play.''Balfour, after his second blown save of the season, said, ''I'm going to have my days and some days I'm not. Today is a day I have to move on from.''Colon had not given up a run on the road through three starts and 23 innings before the ninth.Pedro Strop (3-1) got three outs for the Orioles, who moved six games over .500 (14-8) for the first time since July 20, 2005.''It beats the alternative,'' said manager Buck Showalter, whose 999th career victory was one to savor. ''It's like the right side of the earth. I just like seeing a lot of our guys getting a return for what they've been putting into it from a team standpoint.''Oakland was 10-0 when leading after eight innings. It was the Orioles' second win this season when trailing after eight innings, matching their total all of last season.Baltimore starter Tommy Hunter matched Colon for five innings, allowing only one runner to pass first base, before faltering in the sixth. The right-hander gave up two runs and seven hits over seven innings.In the sixth, after Hunter retired the first two batters, left-handed hitter Josh Reddick slapped a high fastball to left for a single and Yoenis Cespedes followed with an RBI double. That put the A's in position to go 9-0 this season when scoring first.It didn't happen.Seth Smith led off the seventh with his second home run, a shot to center on a 1-0 pitch. It was the eighth homer yielded by Hunter in five starts. Markakis opened the bottom half with a double but did not advance.The Orioles got a hit in each of the first three innings, but got only one runner to second base.

After four starts in the major leagues, the Taiwanese left-hander who spent the past four seasons in Japan is 2-0 with an impressive 2.22 ERA.On Saturday night, Chen pitched seven strong innings, Chris Davis had four RBIs, Adam Jones and Robert Andino each had three hits and the Baltimore Orioles beat the Oakland Athletics 10-1.Chen (2-0) allowed six hits and didn't give up a run until Jonny Gomes' one-out home run in the sixth. By then, he led 9-0. He struck out four and walked two.''I feel like very thankful, I feel like the guys behind me supported me a lot,'' Chen said through his interpreter.''A couple innings I couldn't find the strike zone and to support me until the end I am really thankful.''The Orioles matched a season-high with 10 runs, and in the second inning scored five runs on a season-high six hits.''It was good for us to put some distance between us and give our bullpen a break,'' Davis said.Chen has allowed just two runs in his last two starts.''I feel like I am getting improved every time I go out on the mound. I feel like I am getting better and better,'' Chen said.He also survived a hard-hit ball back to his abdomen in the fourth with a runner on first, and chided himself for getting just one out.''If I can catch it, it's definitely a double play,'' Chen said.Josh Reddick was hitless in three at-bats against Chen.''He didn't overpower us, we just missed him a lot,'' Reddick said.The Orioles are now 13-8 and haven't been more than five games above .500 since July 20, 2005.Oakland, which was a game above .500 for the first time since last May 18, fell back to 11-11.Athletics manager Bob Melvin was more critical of his team's offense than offering praise to Chen.''I am not going to say he didn't throw the ball well. I am just saying we had opportunities that we didn't take advantage of. I think he probably gained confidence from that,'' Melvin said.''I haven't seen him enough to say what kind of pitcher he is. The numbers he has put up are indicative of a good pitcher.''Jones led off the second by beating out an infield hit off Tyson Ross (1-1). Wilson Betemit singled him to third. Jones scored on Davis' single, and when Ronny Paulino faked the bunt, Oakland catcher Kurt Suzuki tried to pick Betemit off but the throw was wild and runners moved up a base. Betemit and Davis scored on Ronny Paulino's base hit. Paulino scored on Andino's single, and after Nolan Reimold singled, Andino scored on J.J. Hardy's sacrifice fly to center.The Orioles added a run in the third on a single by Jones and a double by Betemit.Baltimore added three in the fifth on an RBI single by Jones and a two-run single by Davis.Ross was charged with nine runs and 11 hits in four-plus innings.Davis hit his fourth home run of the year in the seventh. His four RBIs equal a career high.The first baseman has enjoyed playing behind Chen.''In the first two starts, got to be nerve-racking. To come over here and play in this league, especially when you're a young guy.

The Birds\' dramatic heroics sealed a  series win over Oakland and a 5-1 homestand.For  most of the afternoon, this game was technically a pitcher\'s duel,  though it was maybe the least impressive pitcher\'s duel I\'ve seen in a  while. This wasn\'t exactly Roy Halladay vs. Justin Verlander, where  you\'re thinking, ""Wow, these pitchers look incredible."" Instead you were  thinking, ""Wow, these...are two bad offenses."" Neither pitcher had  dominant stuff or was blowing hitters away, but very few batters were  able to hit the ball solidly.The  Orioles were facing veteran starter Bartolo Colon, who\'s held the  undisputed title of Ugliest Man in Baseball for 15 years running. The  Jabba the Hut lookalike is still a pretty decent pitcher, though, and he  promptly shut down the Orioles for the majority of the afternoon. The  O\'s had their best scoring opportunity in the first inning, which Nolan  Reimold led off with a double. But the Birds caught a bad break. As  Reimold took off for third with a huge jump, J.J. Hardy smoked a liner,  unfortunately directly to first baseman Kila Ka\'aihue, who easily  doubled off Reimold. The  Birds managed a grand total of two hits in their next five innings.  Both were harmless singles-- one in the second and one in the third--  and neither runner advanced past first base. Then, the Orioles just  stopped getting on base entirely. Colon retired a whopping 11 batters in  a row from the third inning through the sixth, inducing weak pop flies  and routine grounders. Meanwhile,  O\'s starter Tommy Hunter did his best to keep pace. He got some great  defensive help behind him in the middle innings. With a man on in the  fourth, Ka\'aihue smoked a hot shot down the first-base line. Mark  Reynolds, making his first start of the year at first base, speared the  scorcher with a dive, fired from his knees to second base, and then  climbed up in time to receive the return throw and complete the 3-6-3  double play. The next batter, Seth Smith, roped another sizzler down the  first-base line. Reynolds was denied another great diving stop when the  ball bounced off the bag and skipped into right field. Smith greedily  tried to take second, but right fielder Nick Markakis made a strong  throw to gun him down.The  next inning, the O\'s made two more excellent defensive plays. Reimold  reached into the first row of the left-field seats to rob Kurt Suzuki of  a homer, then casually tossed the ball back in like it was nothing. On  the very next play, center fielder Adam Jones made a nifty sliding catch  to rob Eric Sogard. That\'s four consecutive batters who had hits robbed  by great Orioles defense. How many times this year have we been able to  say THAT?The  scoreless tie entered the sixth, but the A\'s pushed across the game\'s  first run with a two-out rally, as Josh Reddick singled and was doubled  home by Yoenis Cespedes. The first batter of the next inning was Smith,  one of just four Athletics in the lineup who\'s hit a homerun this year.  Well, let\'s make it two, as he took Hunter over the center-field wall to  make it a 2-0 game.Hunter  delivered a quality start today, giving up just two runs in seven  innings, and Darren O\'Day and Pedro Strop followed with a scoreless  inning apiece. Sadly, it looked like their efforts would go for naught.  The O\'s wasted a leadoff double in the seventh and erased a runner in  the eighth on a double play. They headed to the bottom of the ninth  still trailing, 2-0.But  there\'s a lesson here: never, ever count out Orioles Magic. Just when  you think you know where a game is heading, BOOM! Something awesome  sneaks up on ya.Colon  took the hill in the ninth looking for the complete game. Spoiler  alert: he did not get it. Hardy led off with a grounder up the middle.  The second baseman Sogard ranged far up the middle to make a nice stop,  but his throw to first hopped past Daric Barton, giving Hardy a leadoff  single. Colon struck out Markakis for the first out, but Jones followed  with a short dribbler to the left of the mound. Bartolo-- displaying  surprising quickness for a man of his girth-- rushed over to field it,  but his hurried throw to first took a bounce and again skipped past  Barton. Barton, by the way, had just entered the game at first base that  very inning. His inability to scoop those two throws (tough as they  were) probably cost the A\'s the game.The  O\'s had two runners in scoring position with one out, and that was it  for Colon. A\'s manager Bob Melvin hoped closer Grant Balfour could  escape the jam. Another spoiler: he didn\'t.Matt  Wieters, the switch-hitting Jesus, who is better at baseball than you  or I are at anything, played the hero. The first one, anyway. Wieters  went fishing for a low pitch and managed to crank it to deep left field,  over the head of Smith. Hardy and Jones both raced home to score, and  THIS GAME IS TIED!! The impressive Camden Yards crowd of 31,793, who\'d  waited patiently through eight boring innings, went absolutely bonkers.  Wieters delivers again.The  Athletics now hoped they could at least keep the game tied. Yet another  spoiler: nope! The A\'s intentionally walked Chris Davis to bring up  Wilson Betemit, who was 0-for-3 on the day.Not  anymore. On a 3-1 count, Betemit sent the crowd into hysterics again,  crushing a deep fly to right-center. The A\'s outfielders could only  stand and watch as the ball landed atop the Orioles\' grounds crew hut  for a dramatic, game-winning, walkoff three-run homer. YOU KNOW IT!!  AIN\'T THE BEER COLD!! THE ORIOLES WILL CRUSH YOUR FACE!! (ahem) Er,  sorry, I got a little worked up there. But why shouldn\'t we? What a win  for the Birds! Betemit was mobbed by his teammates at home plate, and  the atmosphere at Camden Yards was absolutely electric, with fans  jumping up and down and high-fiving all over the place. Great to see  that the Orioles\' largest crowd since Opening Day was rewarded with a  thrilling win. You couldn\'t have scripted a better momentum-starter  going into the Orioles\' upcoming road trip to New York and Boston.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

After their win Monday, the Yankees are 164-79 against the Orioles since 1998.The Orioles have showed brief glimmers of hope early in some recent seasons, only to fade down the stretch.

He allowed 10 hits and struck out 8 over five and two-thirds innings, and said he was ready to rejoin the Yankees.

Over the next 15 days, the Orioles will play the Yankees, Red Sox, Rangers, Rays, and Yankees (again). Now we get to see just what kind of team the O\xe2\x80\x99s really are. Will they stay or will they go?   The O\xe2\x80\x99s we\xe2\x80\x99re swept at home by the Yankees in early April and will look to repay the favor up in the Bronx. All things considered, the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t play that poorly, but will need a significant increase in offense this time around (10 runs over 3 games previously). Luckily, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will face the pitching to do such a thing. Kuroda and Hughes have been extremely beatable this season. Nova, while 3-0, sports an ERA over 5. Can the Orioles take advantage? They\xe2\x80\x99ll counter with Hammel, Matusz, and Arrieta. Another 10 run game couldn\xe2\x80\x99t hurt either\xe2\x80\xa6.   All night games for this one. They\xe2\x80\x99ll be at 7:05pm on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday before the off-day on Thursday. Game 3 (Wednesday) will be on ESPN in case anyone is interested.     Game 1 (Monday @ 7:05pm):   Probable Pitchers:   BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Jason Hammel (RHP, 3-0, 1.73 ERA) NYY \xe2\x80\x93 Hiroki Kuroda (RHP, 1-3, 4.38 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Came over to the American League this season after several with the Dodgers in the NL. Throws a low-90s sinker and generates groundballs over 50 percent of the time. Also has a fastball, slider, curve, and splitter. Use of the slider and curve are up from a year ago.       Key Stats:   Mark Reynolds is the only Oriole with any significant time against Kuroda. Naturally, he\xe2\x80\x99s just 4-21 with 9 strikeouts. Overall, the Orioles are just 6 for 32 off of Kuroda. The Yankees, on the other hand, have hit Jason Hammel very, very well. Alex Rodriguez is 6-15 with 4 HR and 9 RBI. Derek Jeter is 4-13, Raul Ibanez 5-13, and Robinson Cano 4 for 14. All three have a HR.   Game 2 (Tuesday @ 7:05pm):   Probable Pitchers:   BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Brian Matusz (LHP, 0-3, 5.66 ERA) NYY \xe2\x80\x93 Phil Hughes (RHP, 1-3, 7.88 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Good K/9 inning number, but that\xe2\x80\x99s about it from Hughes. Throws a fastball, curveball, change, and cutter. Velocity gets into the mid-90s (fastball) and can dip into the mid-70s (curve). Righties are crushing Hughes right now (they\xe2\x80\x99re off to a .357/.400/.690 line). That\xe2\x80\x99s off from his career statistics, as lefties have generally had more success.       Key Stats:   Nick Markakis has the best numbers from the Oriole lineup. He\xe2\x80\x99s 10-29 with 3 doubles, a HR, and 6 RBI.  Adam Jones is just 4-22, but does have a HR. Brian Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s first start this season came against the Yankees. He went 4 innings and gave up 4 earned runs. The Yankees have hit him well overall. Derek Jeter is 11 for 22 while Robinson Cano is 9 for 22. Andruw Jones is 7-14 with 2 HR and 8 RBI off of Luis Ayala. He also has homers off of Matt Lindstrom and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day.   Game 3 (Wednesday @ 7:05pm)   Probable Pitchers:   BAL \xe2\x80\x93 Jake Arrieta (RHP, 1-2, 4.45 ERA) NYY \xe2\x80\x93 Ivan Nova (RHP, 3-0, 5.18 ERA)   Scouting Report:   Relies mostly on three pitches (four-seam fastball, curveball, change-up). Added a slider this past season, but does not use it often (just 3.7 percent of his pitches).  Has been using it more in 2012, however. Fastball sits in the low 90s. Keeps the majority of his pitches away, but came in on lefties with the slider.   Key Stats:   Nova held the O\xe2\x80\x99s to 2 runs in his first start this season while striking out 7. He did allow 10 hits, however. Matt Wieters is 5 for 11 with 2 home runs. Nick Markakis and Adam Jones also have 4 hits apiece. Jake Arrieta has also started against the Yankees this year.

At least not that I know of.But we all know the Orioles haven\xe2\x80\x99t won since 1997. That sure was an eventful season for the franchise. The O\'s went wire-to-wire, winning the AL East and advancing to the ALCS before falling short of the World Series.Manager Davey Johnson and owner Peter Angelos had a stunning baseball divorce after the season was over, and Johnson stepped down before completing his third and final contract season.And the O\'s haven\xe2\x80\x99t produced a winning season since.I hadn\xe2\x80\x99t intended to revisit all this in such detail when I sat down recently with Johnson, now 69 and the manager of the Washington Nationals,\xc2\xa0before a recent game. My goal was to catch O\'s fans and others up on Johnson, who \xe2\x80\x93 once again \xe2\x80\x93 is managing a team to a winning record. Johnson is well known, of course, in Baltimore. He spans more than one generation of Baltimore fans because he played for the O\'s in the 1960s and managed the team in the\xc2\xa01990s. var adSkipCounter = 0; What I noticed about Johnson is how much affection he continues to hold for Baltimore. You can understand it. In my story for Monday\xe2\x80\x99s paper, I said the O\'s were the team of Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s youth. So while he talked a bit about the current ballclub, he also spoke about breaking in with a team that featured Brooks Robinson and Boog Powell. \xe2\x80\x9cThen came the Palmers, the McNallys, the Cuellars, the Dobsons. Frank Robinson was the best hitter in the league \xe2\x80\x93 triple-crown winner his first year [with the Orioles in 1966].\xc2\xa0 He kind of set the tone and the tempo,\xe2\x80\x9d Johnson told me.That\xe2\x80\x99s the prism in which he still\xc2\xa0looks at the O\'s \xe2\x80\x93 the prism of good days and good memories. Of winning.Johnson didn\xe2\x80\x99t talk too much about Angelos. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not one that looks back,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. What he meant, I think, is that he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spend a lot of time reflecting. But ask him to relive a decades-old baseball moment and \xe2\x80\x93 as you can tell by his quotes -- he\xe2\x80\x99ll usually offer a precise recollection. Ask him to describe the night he signed with the Orioles in 1962, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll tell you what time of day it was and which scouts were present. It\xe2\x80\x99s as clear as if he were describing a double play from the previous day.So I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be surprised if he remembers every detail about what happened after the \xe2\x80\x9997 season. Nor would it surprise me if there were still a few bruised feelings. Johnson, the team\xe2\x80\x99s best manager since Earl Weaver,\xc2\xa0often talked back then about hoping to see tangible signs of support from the owner.For the record, Johnson said he has moved on, and I\'m certain he mostly has. But he sure talked lovingly about the ranch-style home in Baltimore County that he and his wife had remodeled. You just know it had to sting to put that house on the market.Then I called Peter Angelos. He doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give many media interviews these days, particularly during the season. But he agreed to talk.I\xe2\x80\x99m guessing there were a few reasons. After all these years, I think he would like to move past any remaining awkwardness with Johnson. I also think he believes the facts of the 1997 split may not be entirely well known.\xc2\xa0 If you read many of the old accounts and talk to some of the principals, you get the idea that Angelos felt he had little choice but to let Johnson resign. He felt he had been presented with an ultimatum and Angelos, the toughest of negotiators, considered that unacceptable.It was a rough period. If you\xe2\x80\x99re a fan, sometimes you simply don\xe2\x80\x99t care who is right in an owner-managerial dispute. You just want it worked out so\xc2\xa0your team can win.Editor\'s note: Read Jeff Barker\'s story about Angelos and Johnson putting their differences behind them here.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Twenty years later, the Orioles, who are 7-22 at the new Stadium, celebrated another accomplishment as starter Brian Matusz stymied the Yankees to win for the first time in 14 starts. Matusz (1-3) snapped a 12-game losing streak, which was the longest active streak in the majors.Hughes, who attacked hitters with the aggressive approach of a relief pitcher expecting to remain in the game for only an inning, allowed four runs and four hits, including two home runs, in five and two-thirds innings. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      After four mostly unsuccessful starts in April, Hughes and the pitching coach Larry Rothschild decided he should consolidate his repertory to his two best pitches: his fastball and his curve.

(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek)MoreNEW YORK (AP) Hiroki Kuroda and the New York Yankees blocked off the Baltimore Orioles once again.Kuroda pitched seven neat innings and teamed with catcher Russell Martin to nab Nick Markakis at the plate in the key play of the game, lifting the Yankees over Baltimore 2-1 Monday night.Eric Chavez hit an early two-run homer and New York made several sparkling plays in the field, including two by novice left fielder Eduardo Nunez.But the top gem came on Kuroda's final pitch.''It came out right,'' Kuroda said through a translator.Down 2-1 in the seventh, the Orioles used a single, a hit batter and wild pitch to put runners on second and third with two outs. Kuroda bounced a splitter in the dirt and Martin blocked it, with the ball skittering toward Baltimore's dugout on the third base side.Markakis broke for the plate, aiming to score the tying run.''You don't really have time to think about much,'' Martin said. ''It's just reaction.''Martin quickly recovered and made a backhand flip to Kuroda, who planted his right foot directly in the runner's path. Markakis had to reach around Kuroda's leg, and the pitcher's perfect fundamentals gave him time to make the tag as the Baltimore star tumbled into him.''I was convinced I was going to get an out if I had a good throw from Russell,'' Kuroda said.Kuroda and Martin met on the mound during the shaky seventh, going over their plans. It was familiar territory for them - they were teammates on the Los Angeles Dodgers for three seasons.''We had our one opportunity there and couldn't push that run across,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Nicky made a good aggressive play and they made a heck of a play to get him.''''They have to make a great play to get him out. I would be upset if he wasn't aggressive and trying to do something there in a close ballgame like that. Usually, the aggressor wins,'' he said.The Yankees improved 4-0 against the Orioles this year, 43-15 over the O's since 2009 and have not lost any of the last 14 season series to them.The loss denied Showalter his 1,000th win as a big league manager - his first victory came in 1992 next door at the old Yankee Stadium. Baltimore lost for the second time in eight games.Kuroda (2-3) allowed one run and four hits while outpitching steady Jason Hammel (3-1).David Robertson struck out the side in the eighth for the Yankees and Mariano Rivera closed for his fifth save in six chances. A day after Baltimore rallied for five runs in the bottom of the ninth to beat Oakland, there was no comeback against the New York bullpen.Chavez put New York ahead with his third homer, a drive into the Yankees' bullpen in right-center field in the second.With Nick Swisher hobbling and fellow outfielder Brett Gardner injured, Nunez got his first big league start in left field. He wound up catching five flyballs, matching the most by any Yankees outfielder this season.Nunez caught Nolan Reimold's leadoff liner, slid on his knees to pluck Markakis' liner to end the first and grabbed Chris Davis' sacrifice fly at the wall in the second. Before the game, Yankees manager Joe Girardi joked that even when he tried Nunez in the outfield during spring training, no balls were hit his way.''So much for not getting any balls,'' Girardi kidded after the game. ''He was tested with some tough balls and he did an outstanding job.''Nunez, who had four different gloves stuffed in his locker, called it a ''fun'' experience.''I enjoyed it,'' he said.NOTES: Swisher is expected to miss a week with a strained left hamstring. ... Orioles slugger Mark Reynolds went 0 for 3. He has not homered in 63 at-bats this year - this is his first April without a home run. ... Reimold's 14-game hitting streak ended. ...

Including Tuesday night, Reimold has missed six of the club\'s past 12 games, including four consecutive April 21-25, because of severe neck spasms. Although he was dealing with lingering neck discomfort, Reimold had started the Orioles\' past five games, but after getting to the team hotel after Monday\'s contest, Reimold experienced tingling in his hands and contacted head athletic trainer Richie Bancells. Reimold ""had some tingling and numbness in his fingers, which is common with a bulging disk,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""And Richie got him on a train this morning back to our people to look at it."" var adSkipCounter = 0;  Team doctors in Baltimore diagnosed the bulging disk and are treating it with anti-inflammatory medication. If all works as hoped, Reimold could join the team for the series against the Boston Red Sox that begins Friday, Showalter said. ""We\'re going to try a Medrol Dosepak to see if we can get the swelling to go down. There\'s a potential for it that he could join us in Boston to play,"" Showalter said. ""The doctor\'s recommendation is just let it quiet down there. Hopefully, it sounds worse than it actually is. If he doesn\'t get relief from it, then we\'ll see what the next step is."" Reimold, who is hitting .313 with five homers and 10 RBIs, might finally have an answer as to what was causing the spasms. ""I think that\'s what they are thinking,"" Showalter said. ""It all kind of works off the same thing. When your body spasms like that, it\'s trying to tell you something. But it resolved to a point where he could play. We waited one extra day just to be on the safe side. It cropped back up again."" Brooks unveiling postponed The Orioles have moved Brooks Robinson\'s statue unveiling from May 12 versus the Tampa Bay Rays to Sept. 29 versus Boston because Robinson, 74, is dealing with health issues, partially stemming from falling backward off a stage in January. ""I am sorry I am unable to be there for the original scheduled unveiling of the Brooks Robinson statue,"" Robinson said in a team news release. ""My wife, family and I have looked forward to this day for a long time. Due to health issues, I am unable to participate at this time. We are grateful that the Orioles have offered to reschedule the unveiling, and we look forward to celebrating with you in September."" The Orioles are dedicating the statues of their six Hall of Famers once a month this season, with the first having occurred Saturday when Frank Robinson was honored. The Orioles will now have two statue unveilings in September: Brooks Robinson\'s on the 29th and Cal Ripken Jr.\'s on Thursday, Sept. 6, the anniversary of his record-breaking consecutive-games streak. Fans who would like to exchange their May 12 tickets for the Sept. 29 game \xe2\x80\x94 or any nonpremium game this year \xe2\x80\x94 can do so before June 30 at the Orioles\' box office or by sending the tickets to the club, attention: May 12 Exchange, 333 W.

Wada deciding about surgery Left-hander Tsuyoshi Wada will decide this week whether to have surgery to repair a partial tear of the ulnar collateral ligament in his left elbow or attempt to rest and rehabilitate it. On Monday and Tuesday, Wada was examined in California by Dr. Lewis Yocum, who has performed surgery to remove bone chips from Wada\'s elbow in the past. Yocum, the Los Angeles Angels\' team doctor, confirmed the tear and has recommended surgery, according to Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette. Ultimately, the course of action will be determined by the 31-year-old Japan native. The Orioles\' Dr. John Wilckens had recommended only that Wada seek a second opinion. If he has elbow surgery, Wada will be shelved for roughly a year. ""It\'s the player\'s decision,"" Duquette said. Duquette said the tear apparently occurred after Wada had his physical in December and before last week \xe2\x80\x94 though it wasn\'t thought to be the source of the elbow soreness that hindered Wada early in the spring.

As he ran toward the center-field wall, his knee buckled and he crashed into the wall, then fell to the warning track dirt, clutching his right knee as he grimaced in pain.

It\xe2\x80\x99s terrible.\xe2\x80\x9dNo one faulted Rivera for following the same pregame procedures he has throughout his career.An outstanding athlete, Rivera fancies himself a credible center fielder, even pleading with Girardi to allow him to play the position in a game before he retires. Girardi has said numerous times he would like to accommodate Rivera, but was always too worried about an injury to let him go through with it.For most of his 18 years with the Yankees, Rivera has been a fixture in center field during batting practice, along with the other pitchers, whose traditional duty is to retrieve fly balls. But Rivera always chased hits with more zeal and effort, including the one that led to his injury on Thursday.

He has the career record for saves with 608, most of which came after he replaced John Wetteland as the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 closer in 1997. Rivera has five this season, the last of which came Monday when he threw a scoreless inning in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 2-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.

I never thought that the O\xe2\x80\x99s would be as bad as people wanted to believe they were going to be. It just didn\xe2\x80\x99t make sense to me that a team that was as much of a force as anyone else last September would turn into a pumpkin. Yet I never thought they\xe2\x80\x99d dominate as they have thus far. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure that it\xe2\x80\x99s so much about the fact that the O\xe2\x80\x99s took two-of-three from NY this week. To me it\xe2\x80\x99s more about how they did it. The last time that the Orioles held the Bombers to three runs or less over the course of a three-game set was 1965. That was Jim Palmer\xe2\x80\x99s rookie year. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that\xe2\x80\x99s stood out for the Orioles this year it\xe2\x80\x99s been the pitching. Last night was no exception as Jake Arrieta not only pitched a gem (coming off of two starts where he struggled a bit), but went eight innings into the game. Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s final line: 8 IP, 5 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 9 K. This is Jake Arrieta folks; the skinny on him when he came up was that he walked too many guys! We know that his fastball has a certain amount of pop, but I was incredibly impressed with his breaking pitches last night as well. He seemed to place them in the zone on two-strike counts to catch the Yankee hitters looking when they least expected it. In essence, Arrieta stayed at least one step ahead of the NY hitters last night\xe2\x80\xa6pretty much the same way the NY pitchers have done with Oriole hitters over the past 14 years.Matt Wieters started the scoring off with a moon shot into the right field bleachers to give the Orioles a 1-0 lead. As I said yesterday, it\xe2\x80\x99s almost as if the two teams changed places for a day (or two). While NY batters flailed at Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s pitches, the Oriole hitters proved their knowledge of the strike zone and patiently waited for the right pitch. In the top of the 7th the O\xe2\x80\x99s broke the game open when Nick Markakis homered, and Adam Jones and Matt Wieters scored on Nick Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s single to center. Admittedly I did find it a bit strange that Adam Jones was hit by the first pitch after a Nick Markakis home run. Interesting. Jim Johnson made his first appearance in awhile to earn the save in the 9th, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s took the series.I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen some rumblings among fans to the effect that perhaps the AL East isn\xe2\x80\x99t what it once was. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that way at all; it\xe2\x80\x99s just not the Yankees and Red Sox at the top of the division as people have grown accustomed to seeing. The Orioles will have a day off today in Boston before opening up a series with the BoSox at Fenway this weekend. In my heart, I\xe2\x80\x99d really love to proclaim that this team has arrived and is here for business. However it\xe2\x80\x99s still too early to say that for sure. The O\xe2\x80\x99s are still struggling with runners in scoring position, among other things. But yet they\xe2\x80\x99re still winning games and I suppose that says something about this group of players in that they seem to refuse to lose. It all comes back to pitching; the Orioles have the third-lowest ERA in baseball, and the best bullpen ERA.I suppose the question is whether or not they can keep this up. Again, can the Orioles \xe2\x80\x9cstart spreading the news\xe2\x80\x9d that they\xe2\x80\x99re a force to be dealt with as of yet? I still think it\xe2\x80\x99s a bit early. However the early returns are obviously very positive. MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Amber Theoharis sent out this tweet\xc2\xa0following Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s walk-off win against Oakland, which is very telling of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 attitude in games thus far this season. Admittedly going into the last of the ninth last night my thoughts went back to the 2007 Mother\xe2\x80\x99s Day Massacre at Fenway when the O\xe2\x80\x99s blew a 5-1 lead. However if the beginning of this season and this series with the Yankees is any indication, perhaps those days are getting further and further in the rearview mirror.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles: Matt Wieters is the best all-around catcher in ...', '/* Javascript deferred */var addthis_options = ""digg, twitter, facebook, stumbleupon, delicious, friendfeed, buzz, slashdot, reddit, mixx, fark, linkedin, aim, google, myspace, newsvine, technorati, tumblr, typepad, wordpress, more"";var addthis_exclude = ""print"";var addthis_pub     = ""archivedigger"";/* Javascript deferred */OK, it\'s time: Wieters is baseball\'s best all-around catcherMay 03, 2012|By Dan Connolly | The Baltimore SunThe Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 16-9 start has obviously been caused by tremendous pitching \xe2\x80\x93 and specifically starting pitching. Orioles starters have thrown nine quality starts in their past 10 outings \xe2\x80\x93 and have a 1.65 ERA in that time. In the three-game series against the Yankees in New York \xe2\x80\x93 in which the Orioles won two of three for the first time since 2010 \xe2\x80\x93 the bullpen threw 5 2/3 scoreless innings. But what might be getting a little bit lost so far this year is just how good catcher Matt Wieters has been.Simply put, with maybe just a sprinkle of Baltimore bias, Wieters is the best all-around catcher in baseball right now. He has arrived at that spot a couple of weeks before his 26th birthday.We all know Wieters is a Gold Glover behind the plate \xe2\x80\x93 although he has made three errors already after making five in all of 2011. He\xe2\x80\x99s thrown out six of 16 would-be base stealers, good for 38 percent, right around what he did last year.It\xe2\x80\x99s his offense, though, that has taken a huge step forward. He hit his seventh homer last night in the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 25th game. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t hit No. 7 last year until the team\xe2\x80\x99s 74th game on June 25. He leads the Orioles in homers, RBIs (17) and on-base percentage (.391).And did we mention he is a catcher, baseball\xe2\x80\x99s toughest position?If Wieters keeps this up, he should be the club\xe2\x80\x99s first elected All-Star since Miguel Tejada and Brian Roberts in 2005.But don\xe2\x80\x99t take my word for it. Listen to what starter Jake Arrieta had to say about his batterymate after Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s game.\xe2\x80\x9cHe continues to impress me. I\xe2\x80\x99ve played with him since 2007, and he gets better and better every year -- every day, it seems like. And he\xe2\x80\x99s really, really comfortable now in the big leagues. Not that he shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be,\xe2\x80\x9d Arrieta said.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s a tremendous player and very smart and knowledgeable, not only [with] what he does on the field, but his preparation is better than almost anybody I\xe2\x80\x99ve ever seen.

05/05/2012,"[('Orioles-Red Sox Preview - Yahoo', 'The Baltimore Orioles have gotten production from their slumping No. 8 hitter and stellar work from their bullpen to move within a game of a rare sweep at Fenway Park.The Orioles hope those trends continue Sunday as they try for their first three-game road sweep of the Boston Red Sox in nearly 18 years.Baltimore (18-9) is on the verge of completing a 5-1 trip through Yankee Stadium and Fenway. After losing the opener at New York, the Orioles have matched their longest win streak of the season.""These last few years teams have always taken advantage of us,"" center fielder Adam Jones said. ""Now, we\'ve got a series, but I think we need to sweep. We need to be hungry, keep the momentum going.""Manager Buck Showalter\'s bullpen has not allowed a run over its last 21 innings, including 16 on this trip. Baltimore\'s relievers yielded three hits over eight innings in Friday\'s 6-4, 13-inning victory and added 2 1-3 more in Saturday\'s 8-2 rout to lower their major league-best ERA to 1.52.Mark Reynolds came to Fenway batting .136 with no homers and three RBIs for the season. The No. 8 hitter has homered in both games of this series, adding a double in each and driving in five runs.The Orioles last swept three games in Boston from June 10-12, 1994. The Red Sox (11-15) have lost four straight overall and nine of 10 at home.Baltimore should be looking forward to facing Clay Buchholz (3-1, 8.69 ERA), who has the highest ERA in the majors among qualifying pitchers but also leads all starters with a 10.86 run support average.Buchholz could also be eager to face the Orioles since he\'s 2-1 with a 1.33 ERA in four career home starts against them, including a no-hitter. He\'s 5-3 with a 3.26 ERA against Baltimore overall.Reynolds has a double and four strikeouts in six at-bats against the right-hander and Matt Wieters - 8 for 20 with six runs scored on this trip - is 6 for 14 versus Buchholz.Buchholz gave up six runs over 6 2-3 innings to get credit for Monday\'s 11-6 win over Oakland.The Red Sox could use some innings out of Buchholz after Aaron Cook lasted 2 2-3 Saturday, suffering a cut on his left knee in the second inning and staying in the game as Boston fell behind 8-0 in the third.David Ortiz and Mike Aviles have combined for 17 hitless at-bats and three walks in this series.""We\'ve just got to come back and play better,"" Ortiz said. ""It\'s not magical.""Adrian Gonzalez has been the hitting star in this series for the Red Sox by going 6 for 10 to break out of an 0-for-17 slump.Baltimore will start Tommy Hunter (2-1, 4.26), who is 0-3 with a 7.17 ERA in his last six road outings. He\'s 1-1 with a 9.00 ERA in three career starts at Fenway.The right-hander has pitched well in his last two outings, yielding three runs over 13 innings at home. He went seven and surrendered two runs last Sunday and did not get a decision in a 5-2 win over Oakland, and will have an extra day of rest after having an ingrown toenail removed. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles-Red Sox Preview - Yahoo', 'Knocking a quality starting pitcher out of the game is usually a good thing.With the way the Orioles bullpen is performing, the Boston Red Sox may not be in the mood to face any more Baltimore relievers.Before the bullpens factor in Saturday\'s game at Fenway Park, the Red Sox will send Aaron Cook to the mound to make his debut with the club against Baltimore\'s Jason Hammel in a matchup with a decidedly Rocky Mountain flavor.Boston (11-14) plated four runs in five innings off Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen in Friday\'s series opener, but five Baltimore relievers shut the Red Sox down from there, limiting them to three hits over eight scoreless innings. Baltimore (17-9) finally won it 6-4 in the 13th after Chris Davis had an RBI single and Mark Reynolds added a sacrifice fly.The relief corps is perhaps the biggest reason why the Orioles - winners of three straight and nine of 11 - have emerged as one of baseball\'s most pleasant early-season surprises. With a collective ERA of 1.56, Baltimore\'s bullpen is the only one in the majors with a mark below two. Orioles relievers have thrown 18 2-3 consecutive scoreless innings, allowing six hits and a .100 opponent batting average during that run.""As a defense that\'s all you ask for. It\'s a pitching staff that\'s going to go after the hitters and let us work,\'\' center fielder Adam Jones said. ""The starting pitching has been outstanding. The bullpen, if there\'s a word better than outstanding, that\'s what they\'ve been.""Acquired from Colorado in February\'s Jeremy Guthrie trade, Hammel (3-1, 1.97 ERA) has been nearly as dominant for Baltimore as the relievers. The right-hander has allowed two runs or fewer in each of his five starts, but got charged with his first loss Monday at New York, yielding two runs over six innings of a 2-1 defeat.Despite that outcome, Hammel became the first Orioles pitcher with a minimum of four April starts to post an ERA under two since 1989, when Jeff Ballard opened 5-0 with a 1.46 ERA.Hammel spent the last three seasons in the Rockies rotation alongside Cook, whom the Red Sox summoned from Triple-A Pawtucket on Thursday - five days before he could have opted out of the minor league contract he signed in January.The sinkerballer, who spent his first 10 years in the majors with Colorado, is making a spot start in place of Josh Beckett (sore right lat muscle). Cook endured the worst season of his career in 2011, going 3-10 with a 6.03 ERA after missing the first two months with a fractured right hand. He looked excellent at Pawtucket this spring, though, going 3-0 with a 1.89 ERA in four starts.""I don\'t think there\'s any need to really project anything further than this Saturday. We\'d like to see him in a Red Sox uniform in the big leagues and take it from there,"" Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine told the team\'s official website.Boston slugger David Ortiz is 6 for 10 with a homer off Hammel, while Dustin Pedroia is 3 for 4 with a home run and a double.The Red Sox have dropped three straight and eight of their last nine at Fenway, where they are 4-8 on the season for their worst home start since 1996. Boston hasn\'t opened 4-9 at Fenway since 1984.""Everyone wants to play well at home, but we haven\'t. We\'ve got to figure out how to do that,\'\' Pedroia said. ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"
05/06/2012,"[(""Orioles 9, Red Sox 6 (17): Chris Davis' Wild Day at Fenway ..."", ' Six hours and seven minutes after Ryan Flaherty led off the game for the Orioles, the winning pitcher, Chris Davis stood on the mound as Red Sox pitcher Darnell McDonald grounded into a game-ending double play. Wait, what? Long before that, there was a baseball game where Tommy Hunter and Clay Buchholz were the starting pitchers. Both of these guys sucked today; each gave up five runs and neither lasted beyond the fifth inning. J.J. Hardy had two solo homers in the first three innings. Robert Andino played villain for the Red Sox again, launching a three-run home run in the fourth inning that gave the Orioles a 5-0 lead. At the time, it looked like a nice margin, but Hunter mysteriously lost his ability to pitch after that. In the fifth inning, Hunter loaded up the bases and then promptly gave up a game-tying grand slam to Will Middlebrooks. None of that matters, though, because the story of the game was Davis. He had a devastatingly awful day at the plate. He had a platinum sombrero after five at-bats, and he didn\'t look like he had a clue. In his sixth at-bat, he grounded into a double-play, erasing a leadoff hitter. For good measure he made two more outs in the 15th and 17th innings, and in all he had an 0-for-8 on the day. Davis was the designated hitter, which means that he was assigned to hit instead of the assorted Orioles pitchers. As the innings stretched on, the Orioles unleashed their own offensive futility even as one reliever after the next thwarted the Red Sox batters in turn, with two exceptions: Mark Reynolds doubled in Adam Jones to score an unearned run off Vicente Padilla, and Troy Patton was charged with an earned run when Jarrod Saltalamacchia drove in pinch-runner Darnell McDonald on a sacrifice fly.    The stable was empty. The seven bullpen pitchers combined to throw 11.2 innings with only one run surrendered. Then, after Jim Johnson had thrown two innings, the questions began: would the Orioles use the next day\'s starter? Brian Matusz sat out in the bullpen all by himself, but it was Davis, the 0-for-7 with 5 Ks and a GIDP Davis, who we saw warming up, and Davis took the mound. He was the first position player to pitch for the Orioles since Manny Alexander.    No one knew what to expect. Chris Davis pitching! In the bottom of the 16th inning! How could the game fail to end? But Davis started giving back that platinum sombrero, striking out Saltalamacchia and getting an easy flyout from Middlebrooks. He flashed an 89mph fastball and what may very well have been a changeup that he used to whiff Salty. Not even Wilson Betemit (a late-inning replacement) butchering a ball at third base to give an extra baserunner fazed him. Actually, the game very nearly ended right there. The next batter was Mike Aviles, who walloped a fat, hanging pitch to deep center. ""Oh, well,"" I thought, ""at least they gave it all they had."" Then Jones fielded the ball cleanly off the wall and fired a perfect strike to cutoff man Hardy, who then sent a one-hopper to Matt Wieters, who was, naturally, perfectly blocking the plate. Marlon Byrd tried to bowl Wieters over, but please. Who do you think you are? Wieters will not be displaced by a measly name like Marlon Byrd. Get out of his office. Wieters flashed the baseball to the umpire, along with a look like, ""Was that awesome, or what?"" and plate umpire Jim Hoey confirmed what our eyes saw: Byrd was out. The inning was over. Davis escaped unscathed.    The Red Sox had emptied their own bullpen by this time. Who would they send out to pitch? The answer was Darnell McDonald, also in the game as designated hitter, since he ran for David Ortiz. He scored the tying run at the time, so that was good for the Sox, but you could not say the same for his pitching. McDonald looked like a position player trying to pitch. He walked Betemit on four pitches, but Betemit then decided to try to steal second base, and was thrown out by several steps. Betemit (well, him and Hunter) is probably the only reason I will not include ""the whole team"" as an option on the MBP poll. This was one of the stupidest things I have ever seen. You just had a position player pitching issue a walk, looking like he had no idea how to pitch, and you unleash a TOOTBLAN (thrown out on the basepaths like a nincompoop)? Well, McDonald left one over the plate and J.J. Hardy doubled to left, and Nick Markakis showed patience, getting a walk from McDonald as well. First and second base with one man down. Markakis would have an 0-for-4 on the day, but he also had four walks. Up to the plate came Adam Jones. We all know what Adam was thinking. He wanted to blast a pitch. McDonald obliged him, leaving one right in the wheelhouse. Jones had some slapdick moments on the day, with two GIDPs (six total for the Orioles, including in consecutive innings from the 12th-15th) and a strikeout, but there was no doubt about the baseball that he launched up over the Green Monster, giving the Orioles a 9-6 lead. Of course, there was no one left in the bullpen to get a save. Davis would have to defend his own lead. ""Davis forfeit!"" the Fenway crowd chanted prior to Davis\' 13th inning GIDP. ""We want Davis!"" they chanted during Matt Wieters\' at-bat in the 15th. There were two outs then, and Wieters obliged them by doubling. Davis grounded out then. ""We want Davis!"" they kept chanting. Then he shut them up in the 16th inning, and came back out for the 17th inning. Disaster was written in the beginning of the inning. Ryan Sweeney smoked a ball right back up the middle that Davis got a glove on, but it didn\'t have a friendly ricochet. Then Davis walked Dustin Pedroia, looking like he\'d about reached his pitching limit, and Adrian Gonzalez - hitless on the day - stepped up to bat. You and I have both seen the Orioles in recent years. We all knew there was only one way that encounter could end. Then, something funny happened. Davis pounded the outside corner like a seasoned veteran to get a two-strike count, then dropped a sinking split-finger fastball (or who even really knows what it was?) and Gonzalez whiffed pathetically as the ball dove away from him - the seventh strikeout for Davis, and the second as a pitcher. Still, there were two men on base and McDonald came up to the plate for his own chance at redemption. The baseball gods would not save him today. Perhaps he angered them, showing up the umpire as both hitter and pitcher, but whatever the explanation, be it mundane or supernatural, McDonald only grounded the ball to Hardy, a tailor-made double-play ball. Still we held our breath, for we have seen the Orioles mess these things up, but the play was clean, 6-4-3, and the book on a wild game was finally closed. Stat gurus at ESPN tweeted that Davis is the first AL position player to receive credit for a win since Rocky Colavito in 1968 for New York. Of his pitching performance, Davis told the MASN crew post-game, ""I had no clue what was going on out there. Ryan Sweeney almost killed me. ... I kind of blacked out."" With a Tampa Bay loss earlier in the afternoon, the victory means that the Orioles have sole possession of first place in the American League East and they now have a 19-9 record, which could be the best record in MLB depending on the results of Washington and Los Angeles\' games. It is at the very least a tie. The exhausted Orioles, who\'ve now played 39 innings of baseball in the last three days, will return to Baltimore for a nine-game homestand, beginning tomorrow with four games against the Texas Rangers. The Orioles are now 5-1 in the much-vaunted gauntlet. They have won multiple games I would not have believed it possible for them to win, including this one. They have swept the Red Sox in Boston. They have rekindled delicious angst in Boston fans. All of these were tests for the team and so far they have passed, but now the American League\'s best-scoring team looms, and much rides on the shoulders of the inconsistent Matusz to rest a depleted bullpen. Opposing Matusz will be Rangers starter Matt Harrison in the series opener, which is tomorrow at 7:05pm. We just might have a real goddamn baseball team on our hands here.

05/07/2012,"[('Orioles 9, Red Sox 6 (17 innings) - Yahoo', ""BOSTON - In a game that saw position players finish on the mound for both teams on Sunday, Adam Jones hit a three-run home run off of outfielder Darnell McDonald in the 17th inning to give the Baltimore Orioles a 9-6 victory and their first three-game sweep of the Red Sox at Fenway Park in 18 years.  With McDonald pitching for the second time in his career, Wilson Betemit led off the 17th with a walk and was caught stealing. J.J. Hardy then lined a double, his career-high fifth hit, and Nick Markakis walked before Jones hit his eighth homer of the season.  McDonald then grounded into a double play in the bottom of the inning to end a game that lasted 6:07.  First baseman/DH Chris Davis worked the last two innings for the win. With runners at first and second and nobody out in the bottom of the inning, he struck out Adrian Gonzalez (0-for-8) and got McDonald to hit into the double play.  The Red Sox had the winning run gunned down at the plate in the bottom of the 16th, a run that would have been unearned. The Orioles executed a perfect relay to nail Marlon Byrd at the plate. Davis then got the three outs in the bottom of the 17th as the Orioles raised their record to 19-9 (their first time 10 games over .500 since 2005).  Davis struck out his first five times up and then grounded into a double play and grounded out twice, leaving him one shy of tying the major league record for K's in an extra inning game.  The Red Sox came back twice in the game.  After another bad start by Clay Buchholz left the Red Sox in a 5-0 hole, rookie third baseman Will Middlebrooks, in only his third major league game, tied the game 5-5 with a fifth-inning grand slam. Boston was also able to come back again in the eighth.  Baltimore blew the 5-0 lead that was built on two solo homers by Hardy and a three-run shot by Robert Andino.  The Red Sox turned six double plays in the longest game at Fenway Park since June 15, 2001.  The Orioles scored in the first when Hardy connected with one out. He made it 2-0 when he hit his sixth homer of the season with one out in the third, and scored three more runs and chased Buchholz in the fourth. They should have had more, but lost a run with a baserunning mistake.  Buchholz, who heard boos as he left in the fourth, is 3-1 with a 9.09 ERA and at least five earned runs allowed in all six starts.  A double by Mike Aviles and RBI single by Ryan Sweeney got a run back for the Red Sox in the bottom of the fourth inning, and Tommy Hunter wasted the rest of the lead on the first four batters of the fifth -- singles by David Ortiz (0-for-9 in the series before that) and Cody Ross, a walk to Jarrod Saltalamacchia and Middlebrooks' homer.  Middlebrooks became the first Boston players since Daniel Nava (June 12, 2010) to make his first major league homer a grand slam.  The Orioles went ahead 6-5 with the help of Saltalamacchia dropped a foul pop in the top of the eighth, but Ortiz's double, a groundout and Saltalamacchia's sacrifice fly tied it in the bottom of the inning.  NOTES: Buchholz is the second Red Sox pitcher ever to record six straight games allowing at least five earned runs. Red Ruffing had eight straight in 1925. Coming in, Buchholz had more run support (10.86 runs per game) than any pitcher in baseball. ... Righty Aaron Cook, who received 11 stitches to close a spike wound beneath his left knee Saturday, in his Red Sox debut, was placed on the 15-day disabled list. Andrew Miller was recalled from a rehab assignment (hamstring) and became the 36th player (18th pitcher) already used by the Red Sox this season when he relieved Buchholz in the fourth inning. He retired all four batters he faced Sunday, striking out the last three. ... Daisuke Matsuzaka, coming back from Tommy John surgery, makes his third minor league rehab start Monday night at Pawtucket, the start delayed three days because of a minor neck issue. ...

In case you woke up from a long slumber this morning and don\xe2\x80\x99t know what happened yesterday, the O\xe2\x80\x99s swept the Red Sox at Fenway Park for the first time since 1994. However the story of course was the fact that the finale went 17 innings and first baseman Chris Davis was the winning pitcher. So now the dead tired Orioles, who got home much later than they expected and who used every reliever on the roster (and then some) yesterday, return home and get to play the Texas Rangers.Texas is considered the AL\xe2\x80\x99s best team (even though the O\xe2\x80\x99s have a better record). The O\xe2\x80\x99s appear to be on a quest to return to the American League\xe2\x80\x99s elite; it seems that the schedule and now circumstances are fighting them tooth and nail. However in a way I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the deal. When you\xe2\x80\x99ve been down for so long why should they step out and hand it to you? Like many people, I\xe2\x80\x99m cautiously waiting to see how the team gets through the grueling month of May before saying that they\xe2\x80\x99re for real. However so far so good.The O\xe2\x80\x99s will send Brian Matusz to the mound tonight off of a superior effort in NY last week. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Matt Harrison of the Rangers, who\xe2\x80\x99s last outing against Toronto was rocky. In his past two starts, Harrison has allowed 22 hits and 14 earned runs in 8 1/3 innings. That might be a good omen for an Oriole team that\xe2\x80\x99s going to need all the breaks it can get coming into this game. As I said, due to the extra innings game the O\xe2\x80\x99s didn\xe2\x80\x99t get home last night until much later than originally anticipated, and they have to be back at the ballpark this afternoon for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game.The Orioles are expected to make a roster move before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game to help shore up the pitching staff, purchasing the contract of reliever Stu Pomeranz from triple-A Norfolk (potentially sending catcher Luis Exposito down). This is a move that will be made out of necessity more so than anything else. Ironically, Norfolk played a doubleheader yesterday, potentially limiting the availability of their pitchers as well. However Pomeranz didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear in either game, so he\xe2\x80\x99s fresh. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear if he\xe2\x80\x99d be the first guy out of the bullpen or how Showalter would expect to use the \xe2\x80\x98pen tonight, however I think it\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty good bet that he\xe2\x80\x99ll play at some point.Texas comes in at 18-10 after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s loss in Cleveland. Luckily for the Orioles, rookie phenom Yu Darvish pitched yesterday so the O\xe2\x80\x99s won\xe2\x80\x99t see him during the series this week. However there\xe2\x80\x99s a bit more than meets the eye; Texas is still a good team with great pitching. This is all part of the trial by fire that the Orioles are going through as we speak. If they can make it through this stretch in good shape, this team has a legitimate shot at making something of itself this year. However even if they stumble a bit at some point (which might be inevitable given the length of the season), they\xe2\x80\x99ve still made their point to the league. With the grit, bravado, and professionalism that they\xe2\x80\x99ve shown thus far in 2012, the Orioles are at least trying to serve notice to the rest of baseball that \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re Back.\xe2\x80\x9dFollow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Brandon Snyder and the Texas Rangers put on an offensive show against the Baltimore Orioles, who looked very much like their former selves in this matchup of first-place teams.Snyder homered and had a career-high six RBIs against his former team, and the Rangers beat Baltimore 14-3 Monday night to end the Orioles' five-game winning streak.Snyder, the Orioles' top draft choice in 2005, hit a two-run single in the second inning, a three-run drive in the sixth and an RBI single during a seven-run ninth. He played in only 16 games with Baltimore before the Rangers got him for cash considerations in January.''I'm probably going to have to wake up tomorrow and read something to make sure it happened,'' Snyder said. ''It's a special night, being back in Baltimore, but the biggest thing is having my family there.''Snyder went to high school in Northern Virginia and said more than a dozen friends and family were in attendance. Playing well for his team was his motivation as opposed to gaining a measure of revenge against the Orioles.''It's something that kind of bugged me in the past, but they were also the team to give me my opportunity to come here,'' Snyder said.Prior to this start, he had one RBI in 11 games with the Rangers, on a solo homer against Toronto on Wednesday.''He had a good night tonight and I'm happy for him. I'm also happy for my team,'' manager Ron Washington said.The Rangers had lost five of their previous seven games, in part due to a lack of timely hitting. Snyder got it started with his two-out RBI single, and the rest of the team followed his lead.''He got us a big two-out RBI hit. We certainly needed that,'' Washington said. ''Then he gave us a three-run bomb that gave us a cushion, and then he drove in another one. He gave us what we needed.''Texas starter Matt Harrison (4-2) gave up three runs, six hits and a walk in seven innings. The left-hander yielded 15 runs and 22 hits in his previous two appearances, so pitching against the Orioles couldn't have come at a better time - he's now 4-0 lifetime against Baltimore, with all of the wins coming at Camden Yards.Michael Young homered and drove in three runs and Josh Hamilton hit his 10th home run for the Rangers, who got 19 hits in their sixth straight win over Baltimore.Following 14 straight losing seasons, the surprising Orioles entered with the best record in the majors after a 5-1 trip through Yankee Stadium and Fenway Park, but on this night they were no match for the two-time defending AL champions. Starter Brian Matusz (1-4) yielded seven runs and 10 hits in five-plus innings, leaving Baltimore in a 7-0 hole in the sixth.It was the most runs allowed by the Orioles since a 17-3 loss to the Yankees last July.Asked if the defeat could have a long-term effect, manager Buck Showalter said, ''That's not something our guys or I'm going to dwell on. It's part of what we do for a living. You get thrown some self-inflicted things that you have to deal with and nobody's going to feel sorry for you. Hopefully get a good night's rest and turn the page.''Robert Andino and Wilson Betemit homered for Baltimore, and J.J. Hardy had three hits, giving him eight over two games. But it wasn't nearly enough to prevent the Orioles from absorbing their most lopsided loss of the year.''I think we will be able to get past it,'' Hardy said.The Rangers went up 2-0 in the second inning when Adrian Beltre walked, Nelson Cruz doubled and Snyder lined a two-out single to center. Young hit a sacrifice fly in the third for a 3-0 lead.In the sixth, Mike Napoli singled in a run before Snyder chased Matusz with a shot to center. Matusz broke a 12-game losing streak in his previous start against the Yankees, but this 103-pitch outing raised his ERA to an unsightly 5.91.''Any rough outing is disappointing, especially with the momentum we had,'' Matusz said. ''I just didn't keep the team in the ballgame today.''Andino homered in the bottom half to make it 7-1, and Betemit hit a two-run drive in the seventh.Young and Hamilton both connected with a man on against Jason Berken in the ninth.NOTES: The Orioles added RHPs Berken and Stu Pomeranz from Triple-A Norfolk, while demoting Sunday's starter, RHP Tommy Hunter, and C Ronny Paulino. Pomeranz made his major league debut, allowing three hits in three scoreless innings. ... Beltre, who missed the previous five games with a left hamstring injury, returned as the Texas DH. He moved gingerly on the bases. ... On Tuesday, the Rangers will start RHP Neftali Feliz (1-1, 3.81 ERA) against Baltimore's Jake Arrieta (2-2, 3.52). "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

He left Baltimore's Triple-A Norfolk affiliate two weeks ago after a disagreement over whether he would start or relieve.

05/10/2012,"[('Rangers-Orioles Preview - yahoo.com', 'The Texas Rangers\' potent offense hadn\'t been terribly productive on the first two stops of the team\'s 10-game road trip.All it took was a couple of games against their favorite pitching staff to inject some life into their bats - especially Josh Hamilton\'s.The weather did more to stop Hamilton and the Rangers than the Baltimore Orioles, so now they get two chances Thursday to knock around Baltimore pitching after a rainout Wednesday forced a doubleheader.Although they lost four of the first six on their trip to Toronto and Cleveland due in large part to a 4.67 ERA, the Rangers (20-10) didn\'t do a whole lot offensively either. They averaged 4.3 runs, batted .254 and hit four homers.A couple of matchups with the Orioles (19-11) have made those numbers a very distant memory.Hamilton homered in his final at-bat of Monday\'s 14-3 victory and went deep in his first two plate appearances Tuesday. He settled for a double in the fifth inning before homering in the seventh and eighth to become the 16th player in major league history with four homers - the first since Carlos Delgado on Sept. 25, 2003, for Toronto.""Obviously it\'s, other than being in the World Series, the highlight of my big-league career,"" Hamilton said. ""I was saying after I hit two I\'ve never hit three in a game before, and what a blessing that was. Then to hit four is just an awesome feeling, to see how excited my teammates got.""Hamilton had a career-high eight RBIs and an AL-record 18 total bases in the 10-3 win.""Amazing,"" manager Ron Washington said. ""Josh came out tonight, and he wasn\'t going to be denied.""The Rangers slugger is batting .406 overall this season, and .447 (21 for 47) with seven homers and 21 RBIs in his last 11 games against Baltimore.""The expectations and everything, you can\'t do much better than that,"" Hamilton said Wednesday. ""Honestly, I hadn\'t been nervous for a game in a long time but I was a little nervous (Wednesday). So maybe (the rainout) was a blessing in disguise.""He\'s not the only one putting up big numbers against Baltimore. Texas has outscored the Orioles 70-18 during seven consecutive wins in the series and is batting .378 with 16 home runs in those games.The Rangers haven\'t needed all this offense because starters Matt Harrison and Neftali Feliz have compiled a 2.77 ERA in the first half of this four-game set.That\'s a trend Colby Lewis (3-1, 2.97 ERA) hopes to continue in the first game Thursday as he tries to rebound from his first loss. The right-hander had his first poor start Friday at Cleveland, yielding six runs and 10 hits - two homers - over 6 2-3 innings in a 6-3 defeat. He surrendered more than one home run for the first time in 12 starts and had his personal six-game win streak snapped.Lewis has made three starts against the Orioles since the start of 2010, going 1-2 with a 5.03 ERA. Mark Reynolds is 3 for 6 with a pair of homers off Lewis.The Orioles have dropped two in a row after winning five straight but remain among the best teams in baseball.Baltimore\'s J.J. Hardy hit his third homer in as many games Tuesday and is 10 for 16 during that span.Wei-Yin Chen (2-0, 2.76) takes the mound opposite Lewis following the worst of his five major league starts. After giving up four runs over 18 2-3 innings in his previous three outings, the rookie left-hander allowed four - three earned - and five hits with three walks in five innings at Boston on Friday.Chen, who didn\'t receive a decision, threw 100 pitches and wasn\'t helped by a defense that committed three errors.Tommy Hunter (2-1, 5.00) is scheduled to be recalled from Triple-A Norfolk and pitch the second game, which will be his first start against the Rangers since they traded him to Baltimore on July 30.The right-hander was sent to the minors after he struggled in a 9-6, 17-inning win at Boston on Sunday. He was pulled with one out in the fifth after surrendering five runs and eight hits.The Rangers will counter with left-hander Derek Holland (2-2, 4.43), who is 0-2 with a 5.75 ERA in his last three starts. However, he turned in a strong performance Saturday, allowing one earned run in 7 1-3 innings of a 5-2 win in 11 at Cleveland.Holland was impressive in his latest visit to Camden Yards on April 10, 2011, allowing five hits with six strikeouts in six innings of a 3-0 victory.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles began their game against the Texas Rangers unlike any AL team in major league history, hitting three homers in their first three at-bats.That might have been good enough to beat most clubs. As it turned out, the Orioles needed two other long balls to mount enough of a cushion to squeeze out a 6-5 victory in a doubleheader opener Thursday.Ryan Flaherty, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis opened the bottom of the first inning with homers off Colby Lewis to give Baltimore a lead it did not relinquish. The previous team to homer in its first three at-bats was the Milwaukee Brewers on Sept. 9, 2007. Hardy was also the middle man in that barrage.Milwaukee was the third major league team to accomplish the feat, all from the NL.After the three consecutive home runs, Lewis retired his next 18 batters before Adam Jones homered leading off the seventh to make it 4-1. Lewis walked Matt Wieters, and Wilson Betemit hit a drive to right for a 6-1 lead.""I\'ve known Colby for a long time. I knew it was only a matter of time before he settled in,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""We were fortunate to take advantage of it early. We didn\'t mount much after that. ... I thought the tack-on runs after the home runs were even bigger.""The five home runs yielded by Lewis (3-2) were a career high. They also were the only hits he allowed over seven innings, and he also set a career high with 12 strikeouts. That made him the first pitcher since 1918 to give up five home runs and have at least 10 strikeouts in the same game.""I can\'t justify that game,"" Lewis said. ""It seemed like one of those days where you have really good stuff and then you miss your spot or something and it\'s just not a hit, it\'s a homer. You can\'t really look at it any other way. It was just kind of weird game.""Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen (3-0) gave up two runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings, striking out five and walking one. The 26-year-old Taiwan native has allowed two runs or fewer in five of six starts and has a 2.68 ERA in his rookie season.""Definitely, this is my best outing this year,"" the left-hander said through a translator.""Wei-Yin was a difference-maker today, to get that deep in the game, and against obviously a good lineup,"" Showalter said. ""He was outstanding. He was sharp with his breaking ball, the extra days\' rest. It seems like he had a little bit more finish on his fastball. He was a difference-maker for us today and it won\'t be forgotten.""Coming off a four-homer game Tuesday, Texas slugger Josh Hamilton went 1 for 4 with a single and two strikeouts. He came in with five home runs and a double in his previous six at-bats.The teams were rained out Wednesday night, setting up the doubleheader.After Chen left in the eighth, Adrian Beltre hit an RBI single to make it 6-2. Pinch-hitter David Murphy added a three-run homer in the ninth off Jim Johnson, who got three outs for his ninth save.With Chen leading the way, the Orioles snapped a seven-game losing streak against the Rangers. Texas won the first two games of the series 14-3 and 10-3 and outscored Baltimore 70-18 during its seven-game run.After Texas went down in order in the first, Flaherty hit his first major league homer, driving a 1-0 pitch over the right-field wall to give Baltimore its first lead in the series. Three pitches later, Hardy homered to left, and Markakis followed with his fifth home run on an 0-2 pitch.It was the first time since June 1999 that Baltimore hit three homers in the first inning.Lewis then retired Jones on a fly ball, struck out the next six batters and did not allow a runner to reach until Jones homered.""It was one of the unfortunate things,"" Rangers manager Ron Washington said of Lewis\' performance. ""They put three runs on the board and they just happened to be homers. He kept us in the ballgame. After that first inning, you didn\'t know what to expect. But he settled down and gave us a chance.""After Hamilton flied out to left with two outs and the bases loaded in the fourth, the Rangers closed to 3-1 in the fourth. Michael Young doubled with one out and scored on a two-out single by Yorvit Torrealba.NOTES: The prior time Baltimore hit five homers in a game was on June 30, 2010, against Oakland. ... Derek Holland was slated to pitch the second game for the Rangers, who were 6-0-5 in doubleheaders since dropping a pair to the Yankees in May 2007. ... Texas SS Elvis Andrus extended his hitting streak to nine games. He has reached base by hit or walk in 27 straight games. ...

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) After staging a dazzling long-ball performance in the opener of a doubleheader, the Baltimore Orioles were victimized in similar fashion by the hottest hitter in the game.Josh Hamilton hit his major league-leading 15th homer, Derek Holland pitched six innings of four-hit ball, and the Texas Rangers beat Baltimore 7-3 on Thursday night for a doubleheader split.In the first game, the Orioles set an AL record by hitting home runs in their first three at-bats and launched five in all against Colby Lewis in a 6-5 victory.Hamilton entered the doubleheader coming off a four-homer game and had five home runs in his previous six at-bats. After going 1 for 4 with a single and two strikeouts in the first game, he resumed his assault on Baltimore pitching by hitting a two-run, first-inning shot off former Rangers right-hander Tommy Hunter (2-2).The drive traveled an estimated 442 feet and was the 60th in the 21-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street, far beyond the right-field scoreboard.Asked if Hamilton hit a good pitch, Hunter replied, ''He hit a baseball. The dude's on fire. What do you want me to say?''Hamilton went 1 for 4 in the nightcap, dropping his batting average to .395 but increasing his major league-leading RBI total to 38. In the four-game series he went 8 for 18 with six homers and 12 RBIs.''I was pretty happy I had a good series,'' the slugger said. ''But the series is over with now and we have to go home and think about (facing Los Angeles). It feels like we've only been home 12 or 14 days since we started spring training.''Texas went 5-5 on a 10-game swing through Toronto, Cleveland and Baltimore.The Orioles won't see Hamilton again until August, but now they've got to face the Tampa Bay Rays in a three-game set that begins Friday night.''There's good players coming in behind him,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Tampa's a perennial playoff team. It's playing at this level. There's another challenge right behind it.''After Hamilton put Texas in front, the Orioles took advantage of three Texas errors to go up 3-2 in the second inning. But the Rangers regained the lead in the fifth when Nelson Cruz doubled, Mike Napoli tripled and Elvis Andrus delivered a two-out RBI single.Texas pulled away with a three-run seventh, scoring twice on grounders after Hamilton received an intentional walk.Holland (3-2) allowed three runs, none earned, to earn his first win in four starts since April 18.Recalled from Triple-A Norfolk before the game, Hunter gave up four runs and five hits in six innings. He struck out seven.The teams were rained out Wednesday night, setting up the twin bill. Texas has gone 13 straight doubleheaders since May 2007 without being swept.In the first game, Ryan Flaherty, J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis opened the bottom of the first inning with homers to give Baltimore a lead it did not relinquish. The previous team to homer in its first three at-bats was the Milwaukee Brewers on Sept. 9, 2007. Hardy also was the middle man in that spree.Milwaukee was the third major league team to accomplish the feat, all from the NL.After the three consecutive home runs, Lewis retired his next 18 batters before Adam Jones homered leading off the seventh to make it 4-1. Lewis walked Matt Wieters, and Wilson Betemit hit a drive to right for a 6-1 lead.The five home runs yielded by Lewis (3-2) were a career high. They also were the only hits he allowed over seven innings, and he also set a career high with 12 strikeouts. That made him the first pitcher since 1918 to give up five home runs and have at least 10 strikeouts in the same game.''I can't justify that game,'' Lewis said. ''It seemed like one of those days where you have really good stuff and then you miss your spot or something and it's just not a hit, it's a homer. You can't really look at it any other way. It was just kind of weird game.''Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen (3-0) gave up two runs and six hits in 7 2-3 innings, striking out five and walking one. The 26-year-old Taiwan native has allowed two runs or fewer in five of six starts and has a 2.68 ERA in his rookie season.After Chen left in the eighth, Adrian Beltre hit an RBI single to make it 6-2. Pinch-hitter David Murphy added a three-run homer in the ninth off Jim Johnson, who got three outs for his ninth save.With Chen leading the way, the Orioles snapped a seven-game losing streak against the Rangers. Texas won the first two games of the series 14-3 and 10-3 and outscored Baltimore 70-18 during its seven-game run.NOTES: The prior time Baltimore hit five homers in a game was June 30, 2010, against Oakland. ... Andrus had hits in both games and has a 10-game run. He has reached base by hit or walk in 28 straight games. ... Baltimore put OF Endy Chavez (oblique) on the 15-day disabled list to make room for Hunter. ... Orioles C Luis Exposito got his first major league hit ... The Rangers next face former teammate C.J. Wilson and the Angels at home Friday. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Should the Orioles Select a College Pitcher? - Camden Chat', ' The Orioles are widely expected to select the ""best player available"" with the fourth overall pick in this year\'s Rule IV draft.  Many people believe that this will end up being one of three college right handed pitchers - Mark Appel, Kevin Gausman, and Kyle Zimmer. While I like Appel for the Orioles in this spot (although I expect he\'ll be gone), I find myself underwhelmed by these options, despite these pitchers being in the top of every evaluators draft lists.  So I thought I would take a look at the performance of college pitchers selected in the first round of the draft.  I decided to look from 1998 through 2007, since I think that any earlier and vast changes in the draft and player development would render comparisons meaningless, and later too many of the players are still prospects. In 1998, eleven players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Three of the eleven never reached the majors.  Three have a negative career WAR.  Mark Mulder has a career WAR of 18.4, Jeff Weaver has a career WAR of 13.4, Kip Wells has a career WAR of 7.1, Brad Lidge has a career WAR of 7.8, Matt Thorton has a career WAR of 9.5. In 1999, twelve players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Five of the eleven never reached the majors.  Three have a negative career WAR.  Barry Zito has a career WAR of 33.3, Ben Sheets has a career WAR of 21.4, Jason Jennings has a career WAR of 10.2, and Mike McDougal has a career WAR of 3.1.    In 2000, seven players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Two of the seven never reached the majors.  Of the five who reached the majors, all have a negative career WAR.  None are still in the majors.    In 2001, eleven players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Four of the eleven never reached the majors.  Two of the eleven have a negative career WAR.  Three of the eleven have a career WAR between 0.1 and 2.5.  One has a career WAR of 9.6 (Noah Lowry), one has a career WAR of 15.9 (Mark Prior).  Two are still in the majors, Jason Bulger and Aaron Heilman, both relievers. In 2002, eight players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Two of the eight never reached the majors.  Two of the eight have a negative career WAR.  Jeff Francis has a career WAR of 8.6, Joe Saunders has a career WAR of 7.8, Jeremy Guthrie has a career WAR of 14.8, Joe Blanton has a career WAR of 9.9.    In 2003, seven players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Two of the seven never reached the majors.  One has a negative career WAR.  Tim Stauffer has a career WAR of 2.9, Paul Maholm has a career WAR of 9.9, Chad Cordero has a career WAR of 6.9, David Aardsma has a career WAR of 1.7. In 2004, thirteen players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Two of the thirteen never reached the majors.  Three of the thirteen have a negative career WAR.  Justin Verlander has a career WAR of 28.0, Phil Humber has a career WAR of 2.9, Jeff Neimann has a career WAR of 2.7, Jeremy Sowers has a career WAR of 1.0, Jered Weaver has a career WAR of 25.9, Bill Bray has a career WAR of 1.7, Glen Perkins has a career WAR of 2.7, and Taylor Tankersley has a career WAR of 0.5. in 2005, ten players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Two of the ten never reached the majors.  Two of the ten have a negative career WAR.  Ricky Romero has a career WAR of 11.5, Mike Pelfrey has a career WAR of 4.2, Lance Broadway has a career WAR of 0.2, Brian Bogusevic was converted to an outfielder after washing out as a pitcher and has 2.2 WAR as a position player, Matt Garza has a career WAR of 11.0, and Joey Devine has a career WAR of 1.9. In 2006, eleven players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  One of the eleven never reached the majors.  Five of the eleven have a negative career WAR.  Brandon Morrow has a career WAR of 5.6, Tim Lincecum has a career WAR of 23.2, Max Scherzer has a career WAR of 6.3, Ian Kennedy has a career WAR of 7.9, Daniel Bard has a career WAR of 4.5. In 2007, nine players selected in the first round were college pitchers.  Three of the nine never reached the majors.  David Price has a career WAR of 9.0, Daniel Moskos has a career WAR of 0.2, Ross Detwiler has a career WAR of 1.6, Joe Savery has a career WAR of 0.0, Aaron Poreda has a career WAR of 0.4, Andrew Brackman has a career WAR of 0.1. Total college pitchers selected - 99 Total never reached the majors - 26 Total with negative career WAR - 26 Total starters at the ML level for 2+ seasons - 26 Simply put, these are not inspiring numbers.  Over half the college pitchers selected in the first round never provide any value at the major league level.  Less than 30% will be an above replacement starting pitcher for more than one season.  And of the pitchers who did make it to the majors and find success there as a starter, Mulder, Sheets, Lowry and Prior have all already seen their careers ended by injuries. This may seem counterintuitive, but high school pitchers selected in the first round are as likely to make the majors as college pitchers, more likely to make it there as a starting pitcher, and more likely to be a valuable starter than college pitchers.  And high school position players have an even better track record.  College pitching is as risky of a commodity as the draft has.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles 4, Rays 3: All is forgiven, Nick Johnson - Camden Chat', ' The  Orioles stared down yet another heavyweight of the AL East, schooling  the Rays with a 4-3 comeback win in the opener of a three-game series.  The Birds\' offense once again did all its damage with the long ball,  capped by a clutch two-run, go-ahead homer from the unlikeliest of  sources: Nick Johnson. The much-maligned veteran\'s seventh-inning  dramatics helped the Birds take over sole possession of first place in  the division.Here  we go! It\'s on! A pivotal AL East showdown between the two clubs  battling for the top spot. And both teams brought out their big guns  tonight. For the Rays, it was last year\'s Rookie of the Year, Jeremy  Hellickson. And for the Orioles, it was...Dana Eveland??? Ah, nuts! I  give up.But  maybe I\'m being too hard to Eveland. You know that old saying-- some of  the best players in baseball history really don\'t put it together until  they get to their seventh major-league team. (Nobody says this.)  Eveland pitched a perfect first inning with help from Ryan Flaherty and  J.J. Hardy (who made nice defensive plays on the left side of the  infield) as well as Carlos Pena, who inexplicably tried to bunt (?) with  two strikes (??) and struck out. But in the second inning, it became  apparent that Eveland didn\'t have much of an idea where he was throwing  the ball. His wildness led to a Luke Scott walk and a hit batsman. A  single loaded the bases with nobody out, though Eveland did a nice job  of limiting the damage by inducing a double-play grounder (which scored a  run) followed by a flyout to center. Could\'ve been worse. The  O\'s promptly tied the score on a prodigious blast into the left-field  seats by Adam Jones, his 10th of the year, in the bottom of the second.  Jones is now fourth in the AL in homers. But Eveland continued to live  dangerously. He walked two more in the third, escaping when Scott flied  out to the warning track in left. He wasn\'t so fortunate in the fourth.  Yet another walk preceded a pair of singles, loading the bases again.Then  came a simultaneously ugly and awesome play. Elliot Johnson smashed a  drive to deep right field. Nick Markakis tracked it to the right-field  scoreboard and attempted a leaping catch, but the ball bounced off the  wall. The Rays runners, who had to hold up to make sure the ball wasn\'t  caught, starting making their way around the bases. As it turns out,  they didn\'t get very far. One run scored, but Markakis delivered a  strong throw to Robert Andino, who in turn fired to Matt Wieters at the  plate. Sean Rodriguez, trying to score from second, collided headlong  with the immovable wall that is Wieters. You\'re out, son!! Wieters, as  always, coolly held his glove up to show that he had the ball, giving  that awesome smirk all the while. I love that.Eveland,  though, wasted the chance to cut the rally short. After an intentional  walk to re-load the bases, he drilled Pena on the first pitch, forcing  home the Rays\' third run. It\'s safe to say that Eveland\'s control was  not his strong point. He surrendered SIX walks (one intentional) and  also plunked two batters. Yet, somehow, he was able to squeak his way  out of bigger trouble. He left the bases loaded on a B.J. Upton flyout  in the fourth, then stranded Scott after a leadoff double in the sixth.  It\'s amazing to think that Eveland is credited with a ""quality start""  for this, but there it is-- he held the Rays to three runs in six  innings despite 13 baserunners.A  3-1 deficit looked like it would be tough to overcome against  Hellickson, who cruised into the sixth inning pitching an excellent  game. But never underestimate the Orioles\' ability to hit homeruns, at  all times, on command. Markakis did the trick in the sixth with a solo  blast to the bleachers, his sixth, to make it a one-run game.Hellickson  got the first two outs of the seventh, but the horribly struggling  Chris Davis managed to sneak a single up the middle. Rays manager Joe  Maddon interestingly decided to pull Hellickson there, even though he  was at 95 pitches and still seemed to have something left in the tank.  It\'s not like Maddon was playing the percentages, either-- he replaced  the right-handed Hellickson with a fellow righty, Joel Peralta, to face  the lefty-swinging Nick Johnson.As  you know, Nick Johnson has not exactly endeared himself to Orioles fans  this season, looking washed up and starting the year 0-for-29 before  finally stringing together a few hits. Tonight, though, Nick played the  hero. He worked Peralta for a fine at-bat, running the count full...and  then unloaded a blast to deep right field. OUTTA HERE! Johnson\'s  two-out, two-run homer over the grounds crew\'s shed turned the Birds\'  one-run deficit into a one-run lead. Talk about picking a great time for  your first homer as an Oriole. We loved you all along, Nick! I swear!From  there, the Orioles\' bullpen took care of business. Darren O\'Day retired  all three batters he faced in the seventh, on just six pitches. Pedro  Strop matched him with a perfect, six-pitch eighth inning. And Jim  Johnson closed the deal in the ninth, needing just eight pitches to  retire the side in order. These guys were just flat-out dominant  tonight. Well done all around, and the Orioles are back atop the  standings. What do you say we stay there for a while, huh guys?

When Manager Joe Girardi removed Hughes with two outs in the eighth inning of the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 \xc2\xa06-2\xc2\xa0victory against the Seattle Mariners, the fans rewarded Hughes with a standing ovation.They did so for good reason: Hughes had just pitched his finest game of the season. It was his third consecutive start with marked improvement, reversing course from a forgettable April when Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s spot in the rotation appeared vulnerable.\xe2\x80\x9cAs far as a turning point, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to get any worse than the beginning of the year,\xe2\x80\x9d Hughes said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou build on every start.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Hughes held the Mariners scoreless through the first six innings. Besides a seventh-inning home run from Mike Carp, the listless Mariners offense generated few scoring opportunities against him. At seven and two-thirds innings, it was Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s longest outing of the season, and the one run he allowed was his lowest total in a game this year.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  For Hughes, the key to the May turnaround has been embracing a \xe2\x80\x9creliever mentality.\xe2\x80\x9d It started against the Baltimore Orioles on May 1 with a suggestion by the pitching coach Larry Rothschild, who said he should focus on his fastball and curveball.Instead of diversifying his repertory as many starters do, Hughes mimicked his success as a relief pitcher by embracing what he does best. He also used his changeup to great success Saturday and stayed away from his cutter against a left-handed-heavy lineup.Catcher Russell Martin said the newfound approach had also helped Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s pitching mentality because he was \xe2\x80\x9cnot holding back at all.\xe2\x80\x9d Martin noticed that Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s fastball had more life and arrived in Martin\xe2\x80\x99s glove with more velocity.

The Yankees got all they needed Saturday in the second inning, when Mark Teixeira, Raul Ibanez and Martin each hit a double before Jayson Nix homered to break an 0-for-20 skid and give the Yankees a 4-0 lead. All four runs scored with two outs.\xe2\x80\x9cThose are the runs that kill teams,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said.\xc2\xa0The Yankees added a run in the fourth on Ibanez\xe2\x80\x99s home run to deep center. It was his fourth\xc2\xa0home run in four games, a scorching streak that has made the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 lineup even more potent. Robinson Cano extended his hitting streak to 10 games when he singled home Derek Jeter in the eighth inning for the final run, helping the Yankees to\xc2\xa0their fifth win in six games.Five of the runs came against the former Yankees pitcher Hector Noesi. When Girardi was asked Friday about their former top prospect Jesus Montero, whom General Manager Brian Cashman sent to Seattle in the off-season in exchange for pitcher Michael Pineda, Girardi made sure to mention that Montero was not the only piece the Yankees surrendered in the deal. They also lost Noesi, who pitched in 30 games and made two starts for the Yankees last season.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) It's hard to determine which was more surprising: the Baltimore Orioles playing for first place in the AL East, or Nick Johnson hitting a clutch homer in a come-from-behind win over the Tampa Bay Rays.Johnson's first homer in two years gave Baltimore a seventh-inning lead, and the Orioles held on for a 4-3 victory Friday night.The Rays and the surprising Orioles came into the game tied atop the division with 20-12 records. It was the first time since June 9, 1992, that a two-way tie for first place in the AL East this late in the season didn't involve either New York or Boston.Now the Orioles stand alone in first place, thanks to Johnson. His two-run drive off Joel Peralta (0-2) put the Orioles in front 4-3, and the bullpen made the margin stand up.The 33-year-old Johnson spent last season in the minors and received an invite from Baltimore to come to spring training. He made the team but started 0 for 28 and was batting .143 before his game-changing home run.''It felt great,'' he said. ''I was seeing the ball pretty well tonight. I had my legs under me, I wasn't hitting with skates on the way I have been all year.''Baltimore trailed 3-2 before Chris Davis hit a two-out single in the seventh off Tampa Bay starter Jeremy Hellickson. Peralta then served up a 3-2 pitch that Johnson deposited into the front row of the right-field bleachers for his first homer since May 5, 2010, with the New York Yankees.''I squared it, but I didn't know I got it,'' Johnson said. ''I think the wind blew it out. I put a good swing on it.''As the pitch soared toward the outfield, Peralta squatted on the mound and could only hope the ball stayed in the park.It didn't.''I got ahead in the count like I was supposed to,'' the right-hander said. ''Then I throw some really good pitches that I thought for sure he was going to swing at. He didn't. I know he's a good hitter. In the end, I just throw a fastball that was supposed to be down and away. I missed the spot and he got it. That was the game right there.''Adam Jones and Nick Markakis also connected for the Orioles, who lead the majors with 53 homers.Darren O'Day (3-0) pitched the seventh, Pedro Strop worked a perfect eighth and Jim Johnson got three straight outs for his 10th save.Tampa Bay, which was hitless after the fifth inning, has lost five of six. Rays designated hitter Luke Scott, who played the previous four seasons with Baltimore, went 1 for 3 with a walk and scored a run.Dana Eveland walked six and hit two batters over six innings in his Orioles debut, yielding three runs and five hits. Obtained in a December trade with the Los Angeles Dodgers, Eveland toiled in the minors for Baltimore before being summoned for this game.The Rays loaded the bases with no outs in the second inning but got only one run, on a double-play grounder by Sean Rodriguez.Jones tied it in the bottom half with his 10th home run, a drive deep into the left-field seats on a 3-2 pitch.Tampa Bay took a 3-1 lead in the fourth, but might have had more if not for a gritty play by Orioles catcher Matt Wieters. With the bases loaded and one out, Elliot Johnson hit a liner off the right-field wall that scored Matt Joyce and sent Rodriguez hustling from second to home.Markakis threw to second baseman Robert Andino, whose relay got to Wieters an instant before Rodriguez arrived. Rodriguez led with his left shoulder and barreled into Wieters, who made the tag and held onto the ball despite being thrust backward several feet.''I knew it was going to be a bang-bang,'' Wieters said. ''I wasn't sure he was going to slide or come in strong, and I made sure to hold onto the ball.''Said Rodriguez: ''He's definitely bigger than me. His foot was in front of the bag so I was like I got nowhere to slide, I got to get him, try to see if I could knock it loose. He held on to it. Credit to him.''Eveland then issued an intentional walk to load the bases before hitting Carlos Pena with a pitch to force in a run.Markakis hit his sixth homer, the third in four games, to make it 3-2 in the sixth.NOTES: To make room for Eveland, the Orioles placed RHP Matt Lindstrom (finger) on the 15-day disabled list. ... Tampa Bay OF Desmond Jennings missed a fourth straight start with a left knee sprain. ... Baltimore Ravens safety Ed Reed threw out the ceremonial first pitch. He also took batting practice before the game. ... Pena went 0 for 4 and is 3 for 35 with 13 strikeouts in his last nine games. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Juuussst in the Nick of time', 'If you read as many message boards and other columns as I do on a daily basis, you probably know that people have been calling for Nick Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s head. As of this morning, Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s hitting .163 on the year with an OBP of .250. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t get his first hit of the season until a week-and-a-half ago in New York, and there was even some speculation that he could be getting sent to the minors so the O\xe2\x80\x99s could call up Dana Eveland in last night\xe2\x80\x99s start. However luckily for Johnson (and for the same Oriole fans that wanted him gone), that didn\xe2\x80\x99t happen.First place in the AL East is at stake this weekend at Camden Yards. As I mentioned above, Dana Eveland was called up from triple-A Norfolk to make the start. In a corresponding roster move, Matt Lindstrom was sent to the 15-day DL after straining his middle finger Thursday night against Texas. Eveland\xe2\x80\x99s outing was \xe2\x80\x9cinteresting\xe2\x80\x9d to say the least. I\xe2\x80\x99ll be honest; I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly impressed. Eveland\xe2\x80\x99s billing was that he was a ground ball pitcher\xe2\x80\xa6he gave up six walks in his six innings pitched. The play that stands out to me was in the fourth when he intentionally walked Ben Zobrist to load the bases, and then proceeded to hit Carlos Pena to give Tampa the lead. He seemed to have control issues all night; while I said I wasn\xe2\x80\x99t impressed, I will give credit where credit is due. Eveland turned in a quality start last night only giving up three runs over the six innings (five hits).However let\xe2\x80\x99s back up a bit; that fourth inning looked like it could have been a huge one for Tampa, if not for Nick Markakis, Robert Andino, and Matt Wieters. Matt Joyce scored to give Tampa the lead on an E. Johnson single, however Sean Rodriguez thought he could slide another run across for the Rays. Markakis got the ball back into Andino, who relayed it to Matt Wieters. Rodriguez literally \xe2\x80\x9cwent Pete Rose\xe2\x80\x9d on Wieters, who took a big league hit at the plate. When I say a big league hit, I mean that Ravens\xe2\x80\x99 safety Ed Reed was in the house and he had to have been impressed. However Wieters held onto the ball, meaning that Rodriguez was out at the plate.The issue a lot of people are having with these Orioles right now is that most if not all of their scoring is coming off the long ball. In one sense you\xe2\x80\x99ll take runs anyway you can get them. However the idea this year was that the O\xe2\x80\x99s were supposed to manufacture runs by getting on base. My personal opinion is that this is just a phase that they\xe2\x80\x99re going through; all teams go through phases over the course of 162 games. However on the other hand the fact is that the Orioles are finding ways to score, and thus ways to win. Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 solo homer in the second inning tied the score at one, and Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 solo shot in the sixth brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within one run (3-2). However it was the most unlikely of unlikely hero\xe2\x80\x99s that gave the Orioles the lead for good. With two outs in the last of the seventh Chris Davis hit a single up the middle which brought the much-maligned Nick Johnson to the plate. On a full count Johnson sat on a fastball\xe2\x80\xa6which he got, and which ended up in the right field bleachers. That gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-3 lead; with Strop pitching the eighth and Jim Johnson the ninth, Tampa never reached base again.\xc2\xa0So after the dramatics of this game, Norfolk Tides\xe2\x80\x99 third baseman Bill Hall sent out this tweet\xc2\xa0at 1:34 this morning. Hall will join the Orioles for tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, however the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have to make a corresponding roster move. My guess is that Dana Eveland will be DFA\xe2\x80\x99d, as it appears that Jason Hammels will be able to make Monday\xe2\x80\x99s start against New York. Hall is a veteran and has been around the bend and back in baseball. So there\xe2\x80\x99s a lot happening on the field, as well as behind the seams for the Orioles that\xe2\x80\x99s helping them to win games. If the Orioles can win tonight and thus be guaranteed of a series win, they\xe2\x80\x99ll lay claim to sole possession of first place in the American League East regardless of tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s outcome. Brian Matusz will try to get back on track tonight, and will be opposed by Matt Moore of Tampa. Moore is coming off of his worst start of the season last week against Oakland, so this will be a matchup of pitchers trying to silence critics.It\xe2\x80\x99s early in the season, and being in first place at sundown on May 13th really means nothing per se. However I firmly believe that winning a series like this with first place at stake would be a \xe2\x80\x9cgrowing experience\xe2\x80\x9d for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s considered a team that always finds a way to win no matter what the circumstances are. Perhaps if they\xe2\x80\x99re able to take this series either tonight or tomorrow afternoon, the Orioles can start making the rest of the league think that they\xe2\x80\x99re in the same category.Follow me on Twitter\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0@DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles purchasing contract of utility man Bill Hall ...', '/* Javascript deferred */var addthis_options = ""digg, twitter, facebook, stumbleupon, delicious, friendfeed, buzz, slashdot, reddit, mixx, fark, linkedin, aim, google, myspace, newsvine, technorati, tumblr, typepad, wordpress, more"";var addthis_exclude = ""print"";var addthis_pub     = ""archivedigger"";/* Javascript deferred */Orioles purchasing contract of utility man Bill HallMay 12, 2012|By Eduardo A. Encina | The Baltimore SunThe Orioles are purchasing the contract of utility man Bill Hall from Triple-A Norfolk, an industry source has confirmed. Hall will report to Baltimore on today and will be available for tonight\'s Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game against the Rays at Camden Yards, the source said. Signed to a minor-league contract on April 23, Hall became a free-agent\xc2\xa0 when he didn\xe2\x80\x99t make the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 25-man roster this spring. var adSkipCounter = 0;  In 15 games at Norfolk, Hall put up a .222/.269/.381 line with four doubles, two homers and seven RBI. Hall has had success against left-handed pitching at Norfolk, hitting .444 (8-for-18) with two homers. He would likely add depth at several positions -- third, short, second and both corner outfield positions --\xc2\xa0but he mainly played third base at Norfolk. The Orioles must make corresponding 25-man and 40-man roster moves to add Hall to the major league roster. Hall spent most of his 10-year big-league career with Milwaukee, where he had a 35-homer, 85-RBI season in 2006, but the Orioles will be his seventh organization since the beginning of the 2009 season.

The Rays won 9-8. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Holding a six-run lead with James Shields on the mound, the Tampa Bay Rays appeared poised to end their three-game skid with a no-sweat victory over the Baltimore Orioles.The Rays won it all right, although it was anything but easy.Elliot Johnson and Ben Zobrist homered, Carlos Pena ended an extended slump with two doubles and two RBIs, and Tampa Bay squeezed past the Orioles 9-8 Sunday to avert a three-game sweep.The Rays led 7-1 in the fourth inning and 9-6 in the eighth, but it was 9-8 when Fernando Rodney got Matt Wieters to ground out in the ninth with runners on second and third with two outs. Third baseman Sean Rodriguez backhanded the final grounder while retreating and fired a one-hopper to first to get Wieters by a step.Rodney got his 10th save in 10 tries in a game that earlier appeared was going to be blowout.''When I ran out on the field I was high-fiving everybody, yelling, 'We had it all the way,''' manager Joe Maddon said with a slight grin.Shields earned his sixth win for the Rays, now 2-6 in their last eight games. Tampa Bay entered the series tied atop the AL East with Baltimore and left town happy to have salvaged the finale.''We never like getting swept,'' Shields said. ''It's a big win.''Zobrist had three RBIs and Johnson scored three runs and drove in two. Pena was 3 for 37 with 14 strikeouts in May before hitting a third-inning double and adding a two-run double in the fourth to make it 7-1.Pena also contributed with his glove by snaring the throw from Rodriguez for the final out.''On the last play, it seemed (Rodriguez) fell a little bit and he had to get something on it and obviously Carlos was there to pick him up,'' said Johnson, who had a great view at shortstop. ''(Pena) has a Gold Glove for a reason.''After Baltimore closed to 7-6 in the seventh, Johnson and Zobrist hit successive homers off Troy Patton in the eighth for a 9-6 lead. The nine runs were the most scored by the Rays since April 19, and they needed every one of them.Wieters and Nick Johnson homered, and Nick Markakis had three RBIs for the Orioles, who were denied their first three-game home sweep of Tampa Bay since 2007.''This team never gives up,'' Wieters said. ''We had a chance in the ninth and just didn't come through. It would have been a nice game to win, but at the same time you know this team is going to keep playing hard and we're not out of any game. That's how we feel in this clubhouse.''Shields (6-1) gave up six runs, four earned, and seven hits in 6 1-3 innings. The right-hander is 9-5 lifetime against Baltimore, including 6-1 at Camden Yards.Shields retired eight straight batters before J.J. Hardy doubled in the sixth. Markakis followed with an RBI double and Wieters hit his eighth homer to make it 7-4.''I wish I could have gotten Wieters out right there,'' Shields said. ''That was a really big moment in the game.''A throwing error by Tampa Bay second baseman Will Rhymes preceded a two-run double by Markakis in the seventh.After Elliot Johnson and Zobrist connected in the top of the eighth, Nick Johnson hit a solo shot in the bottom half, his second homer in three games off Joel Peralta.Orioles starter Jake Arrieta (2-4) allowed seven runs and a career-high 10 hits in 3 2-3 innings. The right-hander has yielded 13 earned runs in his last 10 innings and has only one win in seven starts since opening day.''I think it really comes down to four fastballs that were elevated with guys on base that they were able to put good swings on it,'' Arrieta said. ''So, really the only thing I take away from it is, just I got to get the ball down.''After stranding runners at the corners in the first inning, the Rays went up 3-0 in the second when Johnson hit an RBI single and Zobrist followed with a two-run double.Wieters led off the bottom half with a double and scored on a single by Chris Davis.In the Tampa Bay third, Rhymes snapped a 0-for-13 drought by bringing home Pena with a two-out single. The Rays went up 7-1 when Matt Joyce singled in a run and Pena delivered a two-out double.NOTES: Tampa Bay's B.J. Upton struck out four times. ...

The Orioles won 5-3. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) What's more stunning than the Baltimore Orioles standing alone atop the AL East?The Tampa Bay Rays committing five errors in a game.Baltimore capitalized on five Tampa Bay miscues and got two hits and two RBIs from Adam Jones in a 5-3 victory Saturday night.The Orioles were outhit 7-6 and struck out 12 times but scored three unearned runs to forge their second straight win in this series between the two top teams in the division. Baltimore leads second-place Tampa Bay by two games and on Sunday will seek to complete its first three-game home sweep of the Rays since July 2007.''I know we won the series now,'' Jones said, ''but we want the sweep.''On Friday night, the Orioles used three home runs to forge a 4-3 win. In this one, they ran around the bases while the Rays booted the ball, threw wildly or were called for catcher's interference.''We were fortunate tonight that Tampa uncharacteristically helped us some defensively,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.The five errors, which included three in the second inning, tied a club record. The only other times it happened were in 2000 and 2001.''We made way too many errors tonight,'' Rays manager Joe Maddon said. ''Normally when you make five errors, you get blown out of games. Tonight we didn't get blown out because of the effort that was there.''Tampa Bay starter Matt Moore (1-3) walked four and allowed four hits in 4 1-3 innings. He allowed four runs, only one of them earned.''He wasn't sharp with his command, but we cost him 20 pitches that would have allowed him to get deeper into the game,'' Maddon said.Orioles starter Brian Matusz (2-4) gave up three runs, two earned, and seven hits in 5 2-3 innings.Luis Ayala got four straight outs, Pedro Strop worked a 1-2-3 eighth and Jim Johnson finished for his 11th save, the second in two games. Baltimore's bullpen is perfect over 6 1-3 innings in this series.Bill Hall, summoned from the minors earlier in the day, hit a solo homer in the eighth to give the Orioles a two-run cushion.Despite a rash of injuries, Baltimore is tied with Texas for the best record in the American League.''We found people that we can play with and we can win (with),'' Strop said. ''A lot of people are asking me, 'Are you surprised at this team?' We're not surprised. We aren't surprised. We've been doing what we were hoping. A lot of people are surprised, but we're not. We are going to keep winning games.''Brandon Guyer homered for the Rays and former Oriole Luke Scott drove in two runs.The Rays went up 1-0 in the second on Guyer's home run, his first hit since being recalled from the minors on Wednesday. He has three career home runs, two against Baltimore.Baltimore scored two runs in the bottom half, courtesy of three Tampa Bay errors. Jones reached on a wild throw by third baseman Sean Rodriguez and advanced on an errant pickoff throw by Moore. After a walk to Matt Wieters and two strikeouts, Jones scored on Steve Tolleson's double to left and Wieters came in when Guyton misplayed the ball in the corner.In the fifth, two more errors led to two more Baltimore runs and a 4-1 lead. Luis Exposito began the inning by reaching on catcher's interference, J.J. Hardy singled with one out and Nick Markakis walked to load the bases. Jones then bounced a single up the middle to score two runs, and he took second when center fielder B.J. Upton fumbled the ball.That ended Moore's night.Tampa Bay closed to 4-3 in the sixth, and this time the Orioles were the ones guilty of shoddy fielding. After grabbing a grounder to third, Tolleson stepped on the base for a force out but threw wildly to first, a miscue that put runners on second and third with two outs. Scott followed with a two-run single on a 3-2 pitch.Notes: The Orioles put 3B Mark Reynolds (oblique) on the 15-day DL and purchased the contract of Hall, who started in LF. ... Rays 1B Carlos Pena was not In the starting lineup. He popped out in the ninth and is 3 for 36 with 13 strikeouts in May. ...

Baltimore is 12-3 in games decided by one or two runs. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), (""Rays 9, Orioles 8: Two out of three ain't bad - Camden Chat"", "" With the completion of today's game, the Baltimore Orioles have gone through thirteen of the fifteen games they'll play in the so-called gauntlet. The gauntlet concludes with two games against the Yankees tomorrow and Tuesday, and should they lose both of those games, they'll still finish the grueling 15-game stretch with a record of 8-7. Should they sweep the short series against the Yankees, their record over that period will be 10-5. Now wouldn't THAT be something? But I'm getting ahead of myself. Because there was a game today and the Orioles lost it. It's a lot easier to stomach a loss like this one, when the first two games of the series are already in the bag and the offense fought back to almost tie a game they at one point were losing 7-1. Jake Arrieta got the start today and was very frustrating. He had his moments, like striking out three in the first inning, but he just couldn't get it together and was knocked out of the game in the fourth inning. He only walked two batters but both came around to score, and he gave up an astounding ten hits in just 3 2/3 innings. When he was pulled for Kevin Gregg with two outs in the fourth inning and the O's down 7-1, you could hardly blame Buck Showalter for going to the mop up guy. The Orioles still have awhile to go before their next off day and with James Shields on the mound, a six-run deficit is pretty discouraging. But wait! Gregg wasn't awful! He got a ground out from Jeff Keppinger to end the inning, and after single by Will Rhymes to start the fifth inning, he got three quick outs.    After being stymied by Shields for five innings (their run in the third scored on an infield single for crying out loud), the Orioles finally broke through in the bottom of the sixth. Back-to-back doubles from J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis made the score 7-2, and after Adam Jones struck out, Matt Wieters hit his eighth home run of the year. It was Matt's second extra-base hit of the day and made the score 7-4. The O's came within one run the next inning on another double by Markakis that knocked in Hardy and Robert Andino. Who is this guy with the home runs and doubles of late? Nice day at the plate for Nick. Troy Patton went back out to the mound to pitch the top of the eight inning for the Orioles, and it turns out that wasn't a great idea. Patton replaced Gregg at the start of the sixth inning and looked fantastic. He struck out the side and then came back in the seventh for another perfect inning. But in the eighth, he lost it. Back-to-back home runs from Elliot Johnson and Ben Zobrist again pushed the Rays to a three-run lead. What a bummer after the clawing back the offense had done. But it's hard to blame Patton, and even Showalter admitted he left him in too long.    The hitters did their best to come back, but they just couldn't get there. Nick Johnson homered (I know!) in the bottom of the eighth, and in the ninth they just fell short of tying the game. Ryan Flaherty led off the inning and reached on an error (how bad were the Rays on D this series?), then with two outs, Markakis walked. One single by Adam Jones later and the score was 9-8 with Markakis on third, Jones on second (he got there on ANOTHER error), and Wieters was at the plate. He hit a grounder to third that Sean Rodriquez just got a glove on, and the long throw to first got Wieters by a step to end the game. And you know that if it only beat Wieters by a step, most other Orioles would be safe. Oh well. Tomorrow the Yankees come to town and Jason Hammel is pitching. Yay! I can't wait.

Throw in his 45 runs batted in and .402 batting average, and let talk of winning the triple crown begin.Hamilton, the Texas Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 star outfielder, leads the major leagues in homers and R.B.I. and is second in average to David Wright of the Mets. Baseball etiquette, though, demands players observe a code of silence of sorts toward individual achievement, and Hamilton quickly dismisses projections of his surpassing Barry Bonds\xe2\x80\x99s 73 home runs in 2001 or becoming the first player since Carl Yastrzemski in 1967 to win a triple crown.\xe2\x80\x9cYou all go ahead,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to reporters before the Rangers 13-6 victory over the Los Angeles Angels on Sunday night. \xe2\x80\x9cJust don\xe2\x80\x99t tell me.\xe2\x80\x9dHamilton completed perhaps the most productive seven days in major league history on Sunday. He hit 9 homers and drove in 18 runs in four games against the Baltimore Orioles and three against the Angels. Last Tuesday, at Camden Yards in Baltimore, he became the 16th player to hit four home runs in a game, in the process compiling an American League-record 18 total bases.

What we all battle as hitters \xe2\x80\x94 you don\xe2\x80\x99t have to try to hit it a mile. The pitcher\xe2\x80\x99s supplying the power.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you make solid contact, it might leave, it might go for a double or a single or whatever. I don\xe2\x80\x99t get wrapped up in trying to do it.\xe2\x80\x9dWith 18 homers through 34 games, Hamilton is ahead of Bonds\xe2\x80\x99s record pace with San Francisco in 2001. Bonds had 17 home runs in 41 games, but quickly reached 20 with three homers in his 42nd.

Wilson said on his Twitter account after Hamilton hit a Wilson curveball for his 18th home run. \xe2\x80\x9cHe might break bonds record this year, no joke.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Still, pitchers continue to pitch to Hamilton, unlike the way they handled Bonds, who was walked repeatedly. Hamilton, who ordinarily does not walk a lot, bats third and is followed by Adrian Beltre, Michael Young and Nelson Cruz in the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 power-laden lineup, which keeps pitchers from just putting Hamilton on base.

That always works in favor of the offensive team. Always. You look at the Barry Bonds treatment, that always worked in favor of the Giants.

He\xe2\x80\x99s definitely capable.\xe2\x80\x9dHamilton insists he tunes out talk of his prodigious production unless he happens to see it flashed across a television screen or is asked about it by reporters.

Attrition has chipped away at the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen, and with Dave Robertson the latest to sustain an injury, Rafael Soriano moved up another rung to temporarily assume the title of closer.But no save opportunity arose. The Yankees were baffled and subdued by Wei-Yin Chen, a 26-year-old rookie starter who pitched masterfully over seven innings to lead the first-place Baltimore Orioles to a 5-2 victory.In a battle of unbeaten left-handers, C. C. Sabathia allowed four runs and eight hits in six innings to drop to 5-1, while Chen (4-0) made only one costly mistake as he added to his quietly growing reputation.\xe2\x80\x9cChen pitched great,\xe2\x80\x9d said Mark Teixeira, who had one of only four hits off Chen. \xe2\x80\x9cHe really knows what he\xe2\x80\x99s doing out there.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Chen was working on a shutout until the seventh when Curtis Granderson turned an 0-2 pitch into an opposite-field two-run homer, his 13th home run of the season.

When the Yankees sent up Russell Martin to pinch-hit leading off the inning, Orioles Manager Buck Showalter removed Chen, who walked off the field to a standing ovation.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Mark Teixeria has tried just about everything to get rid of a nagging cough that has bothered him for the past month.The timely home run he hit Monday night did nothing to change his health, but it just might turn out to be the cure for his season-long slump.Teixeira hit a tiebreaking two-run homer in the seventh inning, Curtis Granderson also connected, and the New York Yankees got three hits from Alex Rodriguez in an 8-5 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.Teixeira had five hits in his previous 33 at-bats and was hitting .220 when he drove a 1-2 pitch from former Yankee Luis Ayala (1-1) into the right-field seats. He also doubled in the ninth and scored on a fly ball by Eric Chavez.''I hope that helps put me on a roll,'' he said.Asked if his two-hit, two-RBI performance made him feel any better, Teixiera replied, ''I'd like to say yes. I want to be positive, but the truth is ... not really. I'm just trying to grind through it. In this game, you're always playing through something.''It was the fourth win in five games for the Yankees, who improved to 4-0 at Camden Yards this season.New York shortstop Derek Jeter got his 3,143rd hit, a single up the middle in the third inning, to move out of a tie with Robin Yount into sole possession of 16th place on the career hit list.J.J. Hardy homered and had three RBIs for the Orioles, who dropped into a tie with Tampa Bay atop the AL East. After going hitless in his first big league game Sunday, Orioles leadoff hitter Xavier Avery doubled, tripled, scored twice and drove in a run.''X had a good night,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ''I was real proud of him.''Yankees starter Ivan Nova allowed five runs and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings. He left in the sixth with a bruised and sprained right foot after chasing down a grounder toward the first-base side. The right-hander took a line drive off the top of the same foot in the third inning, courtesy of Nick Markakis, but shook it off.''On that last play I twisted it,'' Nova said. ''I don't want to miss any starts. Hopefully, it will feel better. It is a little (swollen) right now.''David Phelps (1-1) entered in the sixth and got three outs for his first major league win. Rafael Soriano, the sixth New York pitcher, worked the ninth for his second save.The Yankees are operating without injured closer Mariano Rivera, and manager Joe Girardi revealed that late-inning specialist David Robertson has soreness in his left side and could undergo an examination Tuesday.''I was hoping it was one of those things that would go away,'' Robertson said. ''But it keeps hanging around. Honestly, I don't think it's too bad.''Orioles starter Jason Hammel gave up five runs, four earned, in five-plus innings. He was seeking to become the first pitcher in Orioles history to begin a season with seven straight starts of allowing two or fewer runs.After a 14-minute rain delay, Baltimore jumped to a 2-0 first-inning lead. Avery led off with a double and received hearty congratulations from Jeter at second base after his first major league hit. Hardy followed with an RBI single and Adam Jones doubled in a run.The Yankees pulled even in the fourth when Nick Swisher hit a two-run double following singles by Rodriguez and Robinson Cano.In the fifth, Granderson launched a 2-1 pitch over the right-field scoreboard, the 61st homer in the 21-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street.Baltimore went up 5-3 in the bottom half. Avery tripled in a run and Hardy followed with a drive into the left-field seats.New York tied it in the sixth. A leadoff double by Cano and two walks loaded the bases with no outs, ending Hammel's night. Ayala got Chavez to hit a bouncer to first, but the ball went under Chris Davis' glove and rolled into right field as two runs scored.''I tried to make throw before I caught it,'' Davis said. ''It was hit hard. But it's still a play that's got to be made.''After a one-out walk loaded the bases, Ayala struck out Jeter and retired Granderson on a fly to right.NOTES: Cano went 2 for 5 and is batting .469 (15 for 32) in his last eight games. ... Davis went 0 for 4 and is mired in a 3-for-28 skid. ... One day after making his first major league start since 2010, New York LHP Andy Pettitte said, ''I feel good. I really do.''...

05/16/2012,"[('Chen leads Orioles to 5-2 win over Yankees - Yahoo', ""View photosBaltimore Orioles starting pitcher Wei-Yin Chen, of Taiwan, throws to the New York Yankees in the first inning of\xc2\xa0a baseball game in Baltimore, Tuesday, May 15, 2012. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Pitching well as a rookie in the big leagues is difficult enough. Dominating the New York Yankees is something else entirely.After seven games with the Baltimore Orioles, Wei-Yin Chen appears comfortable doing both.Chen pitched seven innings of four-hit ball, Adam Jones homered and the Orioles beat CC Sabathia and the Yankees 5-2 Tuesday night.J.J. Hardy drove in two runs for Baltimore, which earned a split of the two-game series and improved to 1-4 at home against New York.Chen (4-0) allowed two runs, struck out four and walked two in a masterful performance. The 26-year-old Taiwan native took a shutout into the seventh inning against the Yankees' formidable lineup - and made it look easy.''He located really well,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Command of the fastball was really key tonight. Once he showed them that he could do that on both sides of the plate, the whole world opened up for him.''Chen's first outing against the Yankees came on April 10, when he allowed a homer to the first batter he faced and ended up giving up two runs and seven hits in 5 2-3 innings.He was far better this time.''The first time, the debut I was so nervous,'' Chen said through an interpreter. ''This time, I was just like I've had this experience already so everything was fine to me.''Chen retired 10 straight before Robinson Cano's leadoff double in the seventh.Two outs later, Curtis Granderson hit his 13th home run, an opposite-field drive that barely cleared the 7-foot wall in left - a fan wearing a Yankees jacket knocked his glove into the mitt of rookie outfielder Xavier Avery.''I don't know if it was somebody in midnight blue or black and orange there,'' Showalter said. ''I've got an educated guess.''It was only the third homer yielded by Chen in 44 innings this year, and it got the Yankees to 4-2.Chen came out to the mound for the top of the eighth but was pulled by Showalter when the Yankees sent up a pinch hitter. That enabled the Orioles fans in the crowd of 24,055 to give the left-hander a hearty standing ovation.Pedro Strop got Cano to hit into an inning-ending double play in the eighth, and Jim Johnson got three outs for his 12th save in 12 tries.Chen outpitched Sabathia (5-1), who came in 16-2 lifetime against the Orioles, including 10-1 at Camden Yards. The husky left-hander was seeking to go 6-0 for the first time in his career, but instead absorbed his first loss in Baltimore since April 2009.Jones gave the credit to Chen.''It started with our pitching,'' he said. ''Chen halted that lineup and gave us an opportunity.''Sabathia gave up four runs, eight hits and a season-high four walks in six innings. He had pitched eight innings in each of his previous four starts.''The four walks killed me,'' he said. ''That's a really good team over there. It was a battle.''New York is 5-3 against the Orioles, and no win has been easy.''They're a much improved team,'' manager Joe Girardi said. ''Their pitching has improved dramatically. That's the big difference.''Jones gave Baltimore a 1-0 lead in the second inning with his team-high 11th home run, the first surrendered by Sabathia since April 29. Eight of Jones' homers have either tied the game or put the Orioles in front.Baltimore loaded the bases with no outs in the third but got only one run, on a 6-4-3 double-play grounder by Hardy. Hardy didn't receive credit for an RBI on that one, but in the fifth inning he lined a run-scoring double to left following a walk to Avery.In the sixth, Chen showed his deftness in the field by stabbing a liner by Nick Swisher at eye level for the final out.Baltimore went up 4-0 in the bottom half during an inning in which only one ball got out of the infield. Bill Hall walked and Steve Tolleson singled to right before infield hits by Robert Andino and Hardy produced a run. Hardy's RBI single behind second base handcuffed Cano, whose high throw to shortstop Derek Jeter was too late to force Andino.Granderson's homer halved the lead, but the Orioles made it 5-2 in the bottom of the seventh when Jones singled, stole second, advanced on a grounder and scored on a passed ball.NOTES: Baltimore went 4-5 on a homestand against Texas, Tampa Bay and New York. ... The Yankees placed RHP David Robertson (strained left oblique) on the 15-day DL and recalled RHP Cody Eppley. ... Orioles RHP Tommy Hunter takes the mound for the Orioles on Wednesday for the opener of a two-game series in Kansas City.

But now in the middle of May \xe2\x80\x94 with almost a quarter of the season complete \xe2\x80\x94 it is as if someone picked up those standings and slammed them down on their heads.For the first time since Oct. 1, 1992, according to the Elias Sports Bureau, the Red Sox and the Yankees are the two worst teams in the division. Just a few years before the arrival of Derek Jeter and Mariano Rivera helped rekindle the Yankee dynasty, the \xe2\x80\x9992 Red Sox were 71-88 and in last place that day, and Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s Yankees were 75-84, tied with the Tigers and the Indians for second-to-last.The first-place team that day 20 years ago was the Toronto Blue Jays, who went on to win the World Series. On Thursday, the Jays looked nearly as good, hitting a pair of two-run homers and playing dazzling defense to beat the Yankees, 4-1, and swap places with them in the standings.The Blue Jays are 21-18 and in third place. The Yankees are 20-18, and in fourth. Boston beat the Tampa Bay Rays and improved to 18-20, meaning that only two games separate the Yankees from last place.

They hit well early in the season, and their 178 runs are still fourth highest in the league.

Hardy during the seventh inning of a baseball game against the Kansas City Royals, Thursday, May 17, 2012, in Kansas City, Mo. (AP Photo/Charlie Riedel)MoreKANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) Tack the Kansas City Royals onto the list of teams that are sick of seeing Adam Jones.The Orioles' slugger followed up his eventual winning homer in the 15th inning the previous night with a two-run shot on Thursday, helping Baltimore climb back from a three-run deficit to beat the Royals 5-3 and win their seventh straight road game.The Orioles also improved to 12-1 when Jones goes deep, something he's done each of the last three games. He has 13 homers on the year, a mark he didn't reach until June 25 last season.''He's hot right now. He's really hot,'' said J.J. Hardy, whose two-run single in the seventh inning provided the go-ahead runs. ''He's been swinging the bat impressively.''Jones preferred to deflect the attention from his hot start to his teammates, even though he's heading to a three-game set against Washington with a nine-game hitting streak.''We're just chipping away,'' Jones said. ''You're down 3-0, it's easy to give away at-bats. We're not giving anything away right now.''Brian Matusz (3-4) won for the third time in four starts after enduring a career-worst 12-decision losing streak. He allowed three runs on seven hits and a walk in six innings.Relievers Luis Ayala and Pedro Strop made it through two innings unscathed, and Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 14th save. He's converted 22 straight since Aug. 14, 2011.''We got deep in the game with our starter, which we needed after last night,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''That's a very aggressive team and if you make a mistake, they're going to make you pay for it. But we were also able to use that to our advantage.''Luke Hochevar (3-4) pitched well for six innings. His only real miscue was the two-run homer by Jones in the fourth. But the right-hander ran into trouble in the seventh, allowing back-to-back singles by Wilson Betemit and Chris Davis, the start of a three-run inning for the Orioles.Hochevar was pulled after Davis' base hit, which center fielder Jarrod Dyson grossly misplayed. The ball bounced in front of him and went to the wall, allowing Betemit to score.Reliever Aaron Crow came into the game and got two quick outs, but then walked No. 9 hitter Luis Exposito and leadoff hitter Xavier Avery to load the bases. Hardy followed with a two-run single, helping extend the Orioles' longest road winning streak since 1999.''I just didn't get the job done,'' Crow said. ''I need to go out and attack those guys, and if they beat you, so be it. I just can't give guys free bases and it ended up hurting me today.''Kansas City had ample opportunities to pick up a couple wins against Baltimore, but instead wound up with a pair of frustrating losses in the two-game, midweek series.Jonathan Broxton blew a two-run lead in the ninth inning of the opener Wednesday night, and the Royals eventually lost their third straight extra-inning game. They jumped out to a three-run lead after three innings Thursday before the Orioles mounted their comeback.Humberto Quintero's two-run double and Johnny Giavotella's RBI single to right brought in the runs for Kansas City, but that's all that Matusz allowed in an otherwise strong outing.''With the lineup we have, it doesn't matter what the score is. We're in the ballgame,'' Matusz said. ''It's just a matter of staying tough, staying mentally tough.''Hochevar was just as good most of the afternoon.After watching his ERA balloon to a run per inning, the former No. 1 overall draft pick put together seven innings of three-hit ball in his last start against the White Sox. Hochevar ran his scoreless innings streak to 10 before making a mistake on a 3-2 pitch to Jones.''My focus has not changed from the beginning of the year to now,'' he said. ''Still going out with the mindset of executing quality pitches and fight like crazy to get this team a win.''NOTES: There was a three-man umpire crew after Ed Rapuano left prior to the game for family reasons. ...

He was 56. The team said Hickey died Wednesday at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. He had been in intensive care following his transfer from a Dallas hospital last month after missing the team\xe2\x80\x99s workout before Opening Day. A cause of death was not disclosed. He had been the White Sox\xe2\x80\x99s pre-game instructor since 2004.

A Chicago native, Hickey didn\xe2\x80\x99t play high school baseball. But after\xc2\xa0competing in 16-inch softball and semipro baseball, he was invited to a Comiskey Park tryout and offered a minor-league contract.

They have at this moment won more baseball games than any other team in MLB so far in the 2012 season. Tomorrow will mark six weeks since Opening Day. We all must handle in our own ways the slow unfolding of a season beyond our wildest dreams; whether it will continue, we cannot say, but one thing we do know is that the steady march of success has not halted yet. This is the world we live in, and the Orioles are in first place.There were plenty of chances to have letdown games in this two-game set against the Royals. After a long stretch of games against teams with pretensions of contention in which the O\'s acquitted themselves excellently, would there have been much surprise if they let up just a little bit in ""only"" facing the Royals? Yet we saw last night the same as we saw today, the same as we have seen most all of the season: there\'s no quit in this team. Even starters you might expect to surrender to one bad inning - like today\'s pitcher, Brian Matusz - are hanging in there and minimizing the damage and giving the team a chance to come back from small deficits. That\'s where Dr. Jones and Mr. Hardy come in. Trouble began for Matusz in the third inning. He retired the first six Royals hitters in order, then gave up back-to-back singles by Alcides Escobar and Irving Falu. That brought Humberto Quintero to the plate, who damaged the Orioles yesterday. A hanging pitch by Matusz drove deep to center, where Jones, playing in to try to cut off a run (I guess) could not chase it down in time to catch it. Two runs scored and Quintero advanced to third on a poor throw in to the plate that bounced away from Orioles catcher Luis Exposito. After a strikeout, the next batter, Johnny Giavotella - career .269 OBP - dropped a single into right field to score the third run. Billy Butler followed with a single, and the Royals had their 4-5 hitters due up with two men on base and only one out. This was the time for the wheels to fall off the bus as said bus careened, brake lines having been cut, towards the cliff\'s edge. This was the time for the spontaneous engine fire to engulf the out-of-control bus as the highway brigands riddled its exterior with bullets. This was the time for that bus, carrying our hopes, to plummet into the fiery oblivion that it would surely meet if the crags onto which it crashed did not kill them from impact first. We know these feelings. We have felt them before and we are still unable to shake the certainty that they lurk around every corner. Today they were banished. Matusz got the outs and you could feel, right there, if only the O\'s hitters could solve Luke Hochevar, there was a chance in this game.    The very next half-inning, the Orioles showed why. Nick Markakis led off the 4th inning with his second single of the day. Dr. Jones followed and worked a long at-bat. Then a mistake pitch was left out over the plate and when that baseball landed it was an estimated 411 feet from home plate. In the intervening time it had cleared the center field fence. The 3-0 deficit was cut to 3-2 with plenty of time to go. The home run was the 13th of the year for Adam Jones. He is more than halfway to his career high of 25 home runs and it\'s not even June. At the end of the game his triple slash looked like this: .295/.345/.604.    Matusz would go on to pitch for another three innings, allowing only one baserunner in each of the 4th, 5th and 6th innings. When he left the game, he\'d given up seven hits, one walk to two strikeouts, three runs (all earned) over six innings. This lowered his season ERA to 5.36 from the 5.50 it began the day. That\'s a small step, but considering how many games last year where Matusz failed to lower absurdly high ERAs, it\'s certainly a step in the right direction. He was not great with the bare-minimum quality start, but it was nonetheless his third quality start in the last five games. That\'s three more quality starts than he managed in all of last year. Most importantly, by settling down to keep pitching, he spared a further heavy load on a bullpen that had to pitch into the 15th inning last night. The game was not without its Orioles moments. The top of the second inning saw the Orioles on the wrong end of a strike-\'em-out-throw-\'em-out double play, with Ryan Flaherty striking out as Chris Davis was thrown out at second base. Whatever happened there is something that shouldn\'t have happened. That was the 12th caught stealing for the O\'s against only 11 stolen bases on the year. They have a 47.8% success rate on stolen bases. That is the worst in MLB by a significant margin. Maybe they should just stop trying.    I sometimes wonder if the occasional fascination with stolen bases for the Orioles is a product of the frequency with which they ground into double plays. That 4th inning ended on a GIDP, the 44th for the Orioles on the year. That also leads MLB. Half of teams have fewer than 30 GIDPs. The twin killings are ugly to watch, but so is watching guys who have no business trying to steal bases get thrown out trying to steal bases. Orioles moments aren\'t limited to the O\'s, as Kansas City demonstrated in the top of the 7th inning. Wilson Betemit led off with a single off Hochevar, then Davis (who had a three hit day) blooped a broken bat single to center that Dyson charged to try to make a play on. The ball bounced over the diving Dyson and went all the way to the wall behind him. Betemit scored on the play and Davis took second. He might have been able to take third. This play chased Hochevar from the game with the score tied 3-3. Perhaps to atone for that failure, Davis tagged on a Robert Andino fly ball to right and would have been out by a good throw. Then Davis stood around at third base while Flaherty dropped what appeared to be a squeeze bunt, only Davis wasn\'t running to the plate. How very Orioles, indeed! Exposito and Xavier Avery followed with very un-Orioles-like walks, loading the bases for J.J. Hardy. James Jerry dropped in a single to just the right unplayable spot. Two runs scored on the play and the Orioles took a 5-3 lead that would prove to be the final score. Tasked with getting three innings to hold and then close out the game, the Orioles bullpen delivered, as it has often done this season. Luis Ayala threw a scoreless 7th, Pedro Strop a perfect 8th, and Jim Johnson picked up his major league-leading 14th save when he struck out Dyson to end the game. The Orioles are now 25-14. Last year, they were 25-30 and two years ago they were 25-59. As I finish this recap, Texas has just been defeated by Oakland 5-4 in 10 innings. The Orioles still have sole possession of the best record in the American League. They could end the night with the best, if Boston defeats Tampa Bay later. In fact, if San Diego beats Los Angeles, your Baltimore Orioles will have the best record in all of MLB. You don\'t need to pinch yourself. This is not a dream. This is reality, baby. This is Birdland.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles 4, Royals 3 (15): Gregg and Eveland? I knew it all ...', ' It took fifteen innings, but the Orioles finally won tonight against the Kansas City Royals. Strong performances by both starting pitchers were almost forgotten by the time this one ended thanks to a homer in Adam Jones\' 7th at bat and a phenomenal job by two unlikely pitchers in the bullpen. Tommy Hunter pitched a very effective game, and although he looked like he was losing it a couple times, I\'ll take seven innings and two runs every day of the week. Through the first three innings, Hunter faced just nine batters thanks to two double plays. The Royals were chasing the ball and Hunter got through those three innings with just 25 pitches thrown. It was looking like the beginning of a very good start by Hunter, but the fourth inning got a little dicey. With one out and runners on first and second (courtesy of a lead off walk and a line-drive single), Alex Gordon smoked a ball, and I mean he killed it, towards first base. Luckily for the Orioles it was right at Chris Davis\'s head, so his choice was to catch it or die. He caught it and easily doubled off Butler at first. Hunter only threw 11 pitches in the inning but the Royals were hitting the ball hard and he lucked into the double play. The only two runs Hunter allowed on the night came in the fifth inning. Jeff Francoeur started the inning for the Royals and he popped a ball up behind home plate. Matt Wieters couldn\'t find the ball in the high sky and when Davis realized he raced in towards the warning track behind home plate. It was a valiant effort, but he couldn\'t quite get there. Given new life, Frenchy lined a double to right field. After Mike Moustaskas popped out, Hunter hit Alcides Escobar on a 3-2 count. Chris Getz grounded to Davis at first, who bobbled the ball but got the second out as the runners moved up.    So with two outs, the only thing standing between Hunter and the end of the inning was #9 hitter Humberto Quintero. If you don\'t know who he is, that\'s ok. He\'s not very good, and he wasn\'t slated to be the Royals every day catcher. He lucked into the role when Salvador Perez was injured in Spring Training. Anyway, now that you know who he is, I will tell you that he singled up the middle to knock in both runs. Shame.    After one inning in which he was lucky to escape without a run and another in which he gave up two, I was starting to think that Hunter might be toast despite his low pitch count. Hunter proved me wrong, though, pitching an easy 1-2-3 sixth inning and working out of a jam in the seventh without allowing any more runs. So it was scary at times, but he got the job done. Unfortunately, the Orioles hitters didn\'t have much support for their starting pitcher. Felipe Paulino, making his third start of the season, dominated them for seven innings. The O\'s managed just five hits off of him (four singles and a double), and he struck out nine while walking two. So it was a sweet, sweet sight when Kelvin Herrera came out of the bullpen to start the eighth inning. The O\'s hitters agreed as J.J. Hardy and Nick Markakis greeted him with back-to-back doubles to make the score 2-1. Then, after Adam Jones struck out, Markakis did something very boneheaded: he tried to steal third. He was thrown out by a mile.    You just can\'t do that! Making an out at third base when you\'re the tying run and already in scoring position in the 8th inning of a game! The rally was snuffed, and Wieters grounded out to end the inning. Troy Patton came in to pitch the eighth inning and got two quick outs before a single by Butler and a double from Gordon plated the Royals third run of the night, a very important insurance run. Top of the 9th! O\'s down by two and facing KC\'s closer, Jonathan Broxton. Scheduled to face him: Nick Johnson, Wilson Betemit, Chris Davis. What could go wrong? NJ grounded out, but Betemit hit a fly ball that just kept drifting and drifting and then it was over the wall. Home run! See what I meant by important insurance run in the bottom of the 8th? After Davis blooped a single to left field and Robert Andino flied out, rookie sensation Xavier Avery stepped to the plate. Xavery took two pitches outside the strike zone and hit the third through the hole and into right field. Ryan Flaherty, pinch running for Davis, moved to second base, and Hardy came to the plate. Can he do it? Will he do it? He did it! A single up the middle scored Flaherty to tie the game. With two runners on and two outs, Markakis grounded out to end the inning, and that\'s when the scoring stopped for a long, long time. Darren O\'Day pitched the bottom of the 9th for the Orioles, and although he allowed a lead off single, he was otherwise great. Time for free baseball! Just as the game went into extra innings, the Royals and Orioles bats both fell asleep. Tim Collins pitched a perfect 10th for the Royals, and then Nathan Adcock pitched four strong innings. It was frustrating watching the Orioles hack away at his pitches, and also frustrating to see Nick Johnson\'s double in the 13th wasted. For the Orioles, Buck Showalter turned to two of the most disliked players on the team to hold the tie. Dana Eveland started the 10th inning as Orioles fans wailed at the idea of the fate of the game in Eveland\'s hands. But Eveland pitched three great innings, giving up just one single. With three innings in the books for Eveland, Showalter turned to Kevin Gregg. ""Why do you hate us? Why do you hate winning?"" cried the Orioles fans. But Showalter again proved that there\'s a reason he is the manager and we are not. Gregg pitched two innings with the only blemish being one walk. Finally, in the 15th inning, the Orioles broke through. Adcock was still on the mound for the Royals and he finally stumbled. Markakis hit a long fly ball to right field that looked like it might be home run, but which landed safely in Frenchy\'s glove on the warning track. But then Jones, 0-for-6 on the night, decided to make it 1-for-7. He hit a no-doubt-about-it bomb to left field that Alex Gordon just turned to watch sail out of the park. Finally! O\'s up 4-3! After Bill Hall, who didn\'t start this game, drew a walk, Betemit grounded out to end the inning and it was all up to Jim Johnson to preserve the win. Batter #1: Comebacker to JJ, one out. Batter #2: Broken bat grounder to second, tough play for Flaherty, he gets him! Two outs. Batter #3: Single to right field. Frowny face. Batter #4: On a 2-2 count, Alex Gordon hits a foul ball that ricochets back up and hits him in the nuts. Ouch! Next pitch, foul ball. Next pitch, ball three. Come on, JJ! Next pitch, ground ball to second. Andino has it, he throws to first, O\'s win! O\'s win! Wow. What a game. And we get to do it all again (well, hopefully not ALL of it) in just fourteen hours.

Hunter only threw 82 pitches in those seven innings, and I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that had manager Buck Showalter known the game would go 15 he would have tried to get more out of him. You\xe2\x80\x99ll also notice that Hunter only struck out one batter; that\xe2\x80\x99s what pitching to contact will do. In theory a strikeout pitcher is going to work harder because it takes him at least three pitches to get the guy out. If you\xe2\x80\x99re getting them to put it in play, that\xe2\x80\x99s not necessarily the case.Hunter really grabbed the bull by the horns in this game, and he deserved the win tonight in my opinion. However until very late in the game it looked like he was going to be a hard-luck loser. With the Birds trailing 3-1 in the top of the ninth, Wilson Betemit hit a solo home run with one down to bring the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 3-2. Chris Davis singled to center field, and the comeback was suddenly on. Davis was lifted for pinch-runner Ryan Flaherty, who later scored from second (after being moved over) on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s single. It ended up being one of those bang-bang plays at the plate, and home plate umpire Angel Hernandez ruled that Flaherty slid just under the tag to tie the game.Going into the season we talked a lot about the depth on this team being so much better. This isn\xe2\x80\x99t more true than in the bullpen. If you play this same set of circumstances last year or in 2010 the \xe2\x80\x98pen would have blown it in the last of the ninth and Kansas City would be celebrating at the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 expense. Dana Eveland pitched three innings in relief (following Troy Patton and Darren O\xe2\x80\x99Day), which in retrospect possibly saved the Orioles from having to burn another pitcher. Eveland allowed one hit and struck out two. The much maligned Kevin Gregg also was good for two innings (potentially saving another pitcher), walking one and striking out two. I feel that manager Buck Showalter managed the bullpen a bit more stringently in this extra-inning game as opposed to the 17 inning deal in Boston. (Although granted when you go 17 innings it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to criticize someone\xe2\x80\x99s handling of the bullpen.) The O\xe2\x80\x99s ended up with some relievers to spare, this after only a mere 15 innings!In marathon games as such, it really comes down to who\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen folds first. Based on what we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen, I\xe2\x80\x99ll take the Birds every time in these situations. Speaking of mismanaging the pen, I feel that Kansas City manager Ned Yost perhaps managed himself out of a potential win. He called on reliever Nate Adcock to pitch five innings of the game in relief. Even for a long man, that\xe2\x80\x99s a long time to be in the game as a relief pitcher. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that thoughts of burning the pen out in a game like this crosses every skipper\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a valid issue to weigh. However the short of it is that after getting the first out in the top of the 15th, Adcock hung a fastball to Adam Jones on a 2-2 count which Jones deposited in the left field bleachers. Jim Johnson stranded the tying run at second in the last of the inning to complete the unlikely comeback win for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.Going back to managing the bullpen in these kinds of games, I\xe2\x80\x99m not overly concerned about today\xe2\x80\x99s game in Kansas City because their bullpen is in the same taxed situation as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 might be. However moving forward one has to hope that Oriole starters can continue to go deeper into games to avoid using the bullpen too much in the next couple of days as the O\xe2\x80\x99s head to DC after this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s matinee. The good news in the interim is that as I said above the Orioles have two relievers in Ayala and Strop that weren\xe2\x80\x99t used last night. I would expect them to be the first ones out of the pen today if needed, and if the Orioles can get out of Kansas City without having to use anyone else (other than perhaps Jim Johnson) everyone that pitched last night will be fairly rested heading to DC.Ultimately that means that the Orioles need Brian Matusz to go deep into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game. If he struggles and ends up getting yanked after four innings or so, that might put the entire relief staff at risk for some burn out in the aftermath of this series. However Matusz did look good in his last start against Tampa, although he only pitched 5.2 innings. The Orioles are probably looking for him to go somewhere in the neighborhood of seven tonight. I would also expect that Matt Wieters will not play today given the day game after a very long night game scenario. Matusz will be opposed by Luke Hochevar, who went deep into his last start against Chicago. However in his career, Hochevar is only 1-4 against the O\xe2\x80\x99s with a 6.63 ERA.On a side note, manager Buck Showalter apparently was taken ill during the day yesterday due to an undisclosed reason. He went \xe2\x80\x9csomeplace\xe2\x80\x9d with trainer Richie Bancells to get it \xe2\x80\x9cchecked out,\xe2\x80\x9d and apparently everything is fine. I\xe2\x80\x99m not going to speculate on what it was, however I\xe2\x80\x99ll just leave it at the fact that I hope all is well with Buck.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"
05/18/2012,"[('Orioles\\u2019 baseball, Esskay hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet', 'First off, thanks to anyone who read the \xe2\x80\x9cjoint column\xe2\x80\x9d that I posted with Aaron Somers of District On Deck this morning! Our plan is to publish a similar piece prior to the series next month at Camden Yards as well. Let me also say that I\xe2\x80\x99m not a \xe2\x80\x9cChevy guy\xe2\x80\x9d (see the title), but this is a play on words based on a popular commercial featuring Prince Fielder. I thought it was appropriate given that baseball, hot dogs, apple pie, and Chevrolet\xe2\x80\x99s are considered \xe2\x80\x9call-American.\xe2\x80\x9d With the Orioles in Washington DC playing the Washington Nationals this weekend, I felt it sent a good message!\xc2\xa0The O\xe2\x80\x99s of course are coming off of a quick mini-series sweep of the Kansas City Royals. The Birds defeated Kansas City 5-3 yesterday behind a great effort by Brian Matusz and some timely Adam Jones hitting. Earlier this week I was on Ricky Keeler\xe2\x80\x99s (from Yanks Go Yard) podcast talking Orioles/Yankees, and I said that Buck Showalter seems to use a differnt lineup everyday. Ironically that seems to be to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 benefit because it keeps other teams on their toes, and it gives Buck Showalter a lot of flexibility in terms of who plays where and when. Last year when the Orioles went to National League ballparks for interleague play I remember wondering how Showalter would make up for the potential loss of power with Vladimir Guerrero being the everyday DH. While the Orioles lead the majors in home runs this season is also about getting on base. The fact is that the Orioles can create base runners with Wilson Betemit playing third, Chris Davis at first, Ryan Flaherty pinch hitting, or any other combination.The concern offensively of course is that Jake Arrieta is going to have to grab a bat and hit in the order tonight. For the record Arrieta is 1-for-7 lifetime at the plate, with an RBI, a walk and two strike outs. That\xe2\x80\x99s a feature of interleague play that the Orioles (along with the rest of the American League) will have to accept. However you never know what\xe2\x80\x99s going to happen when pitchers hit; last season we were treated to Zach Britton\xe2\x80\x99s first career home run in Atlanta, and in 2008 reliever Danys Baez plated the go-ahead run for the O\xe2\x80\x99s in Washington on a swinging bunt. The O\xe2\x80\x99s would love to see something similar out of Arrieta tonight.More importantly for Arrieta will be getting back on track after two poor outings in a row. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be facing a Washington Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 lineup that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat similar to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 own in that they feel they can beat anyone at anytime. Washington\xe2\x80\x99s happy to have Ryan Zimmerman and Adam LaRoche back from injuries, and of course they have the potent bat of Bryce Harper. Ideally Arrieta will need to keep the ball on the ground in order to keep his team in the game, however that\xe2\x80\x99s easier said than done against a team who\xe2\x80\x99s lead off hitter (Ian Desmond) appears to be a bit of a slugger as well. Arrieta\xe2\x80\x99s success or failure comes more from behind the seams than it does from his arm. If he can get ahead in counts and not let the hitters dictate how the at-bat is going to go, he\xe2\x80\x99ll have a much better chance at success.But let\xe2\x80\x99s not kid ourselves; Washington\xe2\x80\x99s not the only team in the park that\xe2\x80\x99s seeing success at the plate. The \xe2\x80\x9cFighting Showalters\xe2\x80\x9d have shown the propensity to do what\xe2\x80\x99s been lacking in recent years, and that\xe2\x80\x99s get the timely hit. This is a team that will never give up until the last out is recorded, and Washington starter Edwin Jackson should be put on notice of that fact. On one hand, the O\xe2\x80\x99s probably aren\xe2\x80\x99t looking forward to seeing Washington\xe2\x80\x99s starting rotation this weekend. However are Washington\xe2\x80\x99s starters really looking forward to seeing the likes of Jones, Wieters, Markakis, and even Robert Andino?I touched on this a bit this morning in the joint column, however this is a huge series for this region. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that either franchise, or MLB themselves could have asked for much more than the records these two teams are bringing into this series. In the past the two sides have played for local bragging rights, which more than anything else is something for fans on both sides to talk about. However this time around it\xe2\x80\x99s going to be different. If anything keeping the season going at the current pace is on the line on both sides, which quite frankly is more important than local bragging rights. MASN, which covers both teams, will mix their broadcast booth again this year with Jim Hunter and Mike Bordick from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 side, and Bob Carpenter and F.P. Santangelo from the Nats\xe2\x80\x99 side. Bordick and Santangelo will offer color commentary for the entire game(s), while Carpenter and Hunter will split the play-by-play duties. Both teams\xe2\x80\x99 pre/post-game shows will be produced separately, with the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 channel being MASN2. FOX will televise Saturday night\xe2\x80\x99s game on national television, which again speaks to the fact that this is a huge series with two up and coming teams. The above-mentioned Bob Carpenter will \xc2\xa0handle the play-by-play duties for FOX, with former Oriole Bill Ripken sliding in to do color commentary. Interesting duo, but what else should fans expect for a series of this magnitude in this region?!Put this in the \xe2\x80\x9cfor what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth category\xe2\x80\x9d I suppose. There are several other local/regional rivalry series\xe2\x80\x99 going on this weekend around the league, including: White Sox @ Cubs, Rangers @ Astros, and A\xe2\x80\x99s @ Giants.

Before joining the Baltimore Orioles this year, O\'Day was Hamilton\'s teammate with Texas, and he thought he knew Hamilton\'s tendencies well enough to shake off the slider Matt Wieters wanted him to throw.View photosWhat O\'Day realized 425 feet later \xe2\x80\x93 what every Baltimore Orioles pitcher learns eventually \xe2\x80\x93 is that no matter how well he thinks he knows what to throw, he doesn\'t know better than Wieters.""Every time I shake him off, I give up a hit,"" O\'Day said. ""It\'s the truth. The home run I threw to Josh, I shook him off. The pitch to get a runner on base before Hamilton, shook him off. Game before, double to [Dustin] Pedroia, shook him off.""I told him next time I shake him off, just give me the middle finger.""As much as Wieters\' offensive explosion early this season has helped the Orioles\' surprising ascent to the top of the American League East, his encyclopedic knowledge of hitters and their tendencies has cemented his place as perhaps the best catcher in baseball. All of the pre-debut hype that ensconced Wieters, who turns 26 on Monday, finally is being realized, and it\'s not just because he\'s a switch-hitting, home run-raking dynamo who is making the ""Mauer with power"" sobriquet look very real.College teammates had a nickname for Wieters: God. It wasn\'t just that he could do anything; his effect on a game was omnipresent. And while the major leagues make idols into men daily, the growth of Wieters over his four major-league seasons has at the very least turned him into a baseball Apollo, for what he does is as much art as science.Learning the tendencies of major-league hitters is as arduous and unforgiving a task as there is in the game \xe2\x80\x93 and one that\'s normally incumbent upon the pitcher. So to have a catcher who spends so much of his free time learning about those whom he crouches behind is a blessing for pitchers, and particularly one for an Orioles staff that has struggled to develop any semblance of the quality eminently necessary in the cutthroat East.Wieters has helped coax a 3.41 ERA out of a patchwork Orioles staff. When everyone else on the team plane is passing around a bottle of Compass Box Asyla scotch to taste, Wieters defers and buries himself with his iPad to ready for the next series. He understands: The Orioles are going nowhere soon without Wieters and his faculty for knowing exactly what to throw and when to throw it.""The No. 1 job for the catcher is to get his pitching staff ready,"" Wieters said. ""That\'s how you\'re going to win the most games. You want the offensive numbers to be there, but at the same time, the catcher can win more games with his pitch calling and defense.""[Power Rankings: O\'s battle Rays for supremacy in American League East]What Wieters does goes relatively unnoticed because of the paucity of statistics that can quantify his game-calling and receiving talents. Scouts, players and personnel throughout baseball, however, agree that he owns a preternatural talent for excelling at the position\'s intricacies \xe2\x80\x93 from the signs he throws to the runners he throws out \xe2\x80\x93 that puts him in the echelon of the game\'s best.""Everywhere I\'ve been there have been great catchers, and when you compare, they\'re not as good as Wieters,"" Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy said. ""He can throw anyone out, blocks everything, and I think he calls a better game than anyone I\'ve been around. He always throws down the right fingers.""Hardy spent a year in Minnesota alongside Mauer, to whom Wieters draws the most comparisons because of their shared novelty as 6-foot-5 catchers. There have been just 10 in history, and only one, Sandy Alomar Jr., played more than 1,000 games at the position. The tall catcher is an anomaly \xe2\x80\x93 a long-limbed athlete at a position better suited for short limbs, a knee or shoulder injury waiting to happen.And yet Wieters hasn\'t even considered playing anywhere else, not since his father, Richard, a former minor-league pitcher, stuck him behind the plate and taught him to switch hit at 5 years old. Wieters savors the involvement in every play, and the intellectual bonus \xe2\x80\x93 getting a chance to outsmart the hitter more than 100 times a game \xe2\x80\x93 whets his baseball appetite.""You have to get in their mind and try to think like they do,"" Wieters said, ""because if you can figure that out, you win most of the time.""View photosWieters sympathizes with hitters\' plights. Throughout his first three seasons, Wieters often ended an at-bat with the frustration of having overthought his approach. As much as Richard repeated to him an axiom so many good hitters live by \xe2\x80\x93 ""See the ball, hit the ball"" \xe2\x80\x93 Wieters knew so much that it would get in his way.When he arrived at spring training in Sarasota, Fla., this year, he resolved to adopt a new mindset: unplug the mind during at-bats, re-engage it behind the plate.""I\'m trying to turn my brain off at the plate,"" Wieters said. ""As a catcher, information\'s great. You\'re not having to think about swing this way or that way. If you go up looking for a certain pitch as a hitter and don\'t get it, that can be frustrating.""Finally comfortable with his role, Wieters spent the spring honing his game instead of trying to produce. His left-handed prowess cratered last season. He hit 100 points lower from that side of the plate, got on base less than 30 percent of the time and slugged just .371. So he spent the preseason working on his lefty swing \xe2\x80\x93 trying to keep his hips parallel to his shoulders and hit as much with his lower body as he did his upper. While he remains a better average hitter from the right side \xe2\x80\x93 his natural one \xe2\x80\x93 all eight of Wieters\' home runs have come left-handed, and his .852 OPS is best among AL catchers.Keeping his balance has allowed Wieters to drive outside pitches from the left side, a distinct weakness last year. Seven of his homers have come on pitches middle-out. His command of the strike zone has steadily improved \xe2\x80\x93 he\'s swinging at a career-low 43.1 percent of pitches \xe2\x80\x93 such that he\'ll go to two strikes and still look for a pitch to hammer. Half his home runs have come on two-strike counts.This is the Wieters college teammates deified, and the one the Orioles are beginning to likewise. He was one of the first megastars of the prospect era, where kids arrive in the big leagues with more hoopla than they\'ll ever get once there, and the Sports Illustrated cover after a poor rookie season did nothing to cool the expectations.[MLB Full Count: Watch live look-ins and highlights for free all season long]A mediocre second season did that and allowed Wieters room to breathe. Now Orioles fans are clamoring for Wieters to have agent Scott Boras go against type and negotiate a contract extension. The Orioles are game, of course. Wieters?""You\'d definitely listen, but it\'s not something I want to occupy my time with,"" he said. ""I feel like with how good this team can be, we\'re worried about winning, and when you win things tend to take care of themselves.""Whether Baltimore can keep winning nobody knows. Far more certain is what the Orioles staff, and especially Darren O\'Day, understand better than anyone: God knows all.Other popular content on Yahoo!

""There was some unknown, whether I\'d be playing for another team \xe2\x80\xa6 I was kind of on pins and needles.""The Orioles had 10 days to ask waivers or deal Bergesen, but finding no match on the trade market, they decided to push him through waivers \xe2\x80\x94 and he wasn\'t claimed.

Jake Arrieta pitched one-run ball over seven innings and Baltimore\'s major league-leading bullpen lowered its ERA to 2.07 with four scoreless frames.With its fourth consecutive win, Baltimore (26-14) moved 12 games above .500 for the first time since June 2005 - the last year it led the East this late into a season. Baltimore is a major league-best 14-5 on the road, where it has won eight in a row for the time since a 10-game run in 1999.The Orioles also have won six straight in extra innings - all on the road.""Hopefully, it bodes well mentally,\'\' manager Buck Showalter said of his team\'s late-game heroics.

He\'s won four of five decisions and his 2.68 ERA ranks among the AL leaders.Hammel, though, is coming off his least effective outing.Bidding to become the first pitcher in Orioles history to open a season by allowing two runs or fewer in seven consecutive starts, the right-hander instead gave up five runs and seven hits over five innings Monday against the Yankees. Hammel, whose start was pushed back four days due to a sore knee, tied a season high with three walks and matched a season low with three strikeouts before leaving without a decision.""I felt fatigue from just not being on my feet,"" Hammel told the Orioles\' official website.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreWASHINGTON (AP) Nick Markakis let loose on a hanging slider and gave the Baltimore Orioles another extra innings victory on the road.Markakis homered into the second deck in right field to give the Orioles a 2-1 win in 11 innings over the Washington Nationals on Friday night.Markakis' blast off Nationals reliever Ryan Mattheus (2-1) propelled Baltimore to its fourth straight victory. The first-place Orioles improved to 6-2 in extra innings with all six victories coming on the road.''Hopefully, it bodes well mentally,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said of his team's late game heroics. ''When you get in those situations that you've been there and handled it well because, especially on the road, there's such a finality to that bottom of the inning. But the key is our guys are playing pretty loose through that. It's a loose clubhouse. They have a lot of confidence in close ballgames.''Facing the Nationals' fourth pitcher of the game and a 2-2 count, Markakis was not looking for a slider from Mattheus. That's what he got. As it turns out, he was ready for a pitch that Mattheus said, ''kind of hung'' over the plate.''I wasn't expecting that,'' Markakis said. ''I put a good swing on that and went out of the ballpark.''Hits and runs were hard to come by for either side.Four relievers followed Orioles starter Jake Arrieta, who matched his career-high with nine strikeouts. He allowed one run and six hits, walking one in seven innings.Edwin Jackson matched him, allowing one run in eight innings with eight strikeouts and one walk.''That was a tough one,'' said Nationals manager Davey Johnson, who previously played for and managed the Orioles. ''It was a shame to waste such a great pitching effort by Jackson. He pitched outstanding.''Kevin Gregg (2-1) pitched the 10th inning for Baltimore and Pedro Strop worked the 11th inning for his third save. Three runners reached against Strop, but Ian Desmond hit into a double play and LaRoche grounded back to the mound with two runners on.Arrieta entered the game having allowed 13 earned runs over his last two starts, including seven runs in 3 2-3 innings against Tampa Bay on Sunday. No signs of that pitcher existed in the series opener.''(I) wanted to try to command multiple pitches in the zone, and when I got ahead just finish guys off,'' Arrieta said. ''Not let the pitch count run up and try to pitch as deep into the game as I could.''Adam Jones drove home the Orioles first run with a first inning infield single against Jackson. Desmond tied the game with a solo home run in the sixth inning against Arrieta. It stayed that way until Markakis' final at-bat.''We pitched good. Bullpen pitched good,'' Johnson said. ''But one pitch - ball game.''Matt Wieters helped his pitcher by throwing out Bryce Harper and Jesus Flores attempting to steal second base.The 19-year-old Harper was 2 for 3 with a walk.Xavier Avery led off the Orioles first inning with a walk and one out later moved to third on Markakis' double to left center. Jones sent a sharp grounder off Jackson's left heel. The ball caromed behind the mound, allowing Avery to score from third.Jackson escaped further damage by inducing Wieters into an inning-ending double play grounder. He then settled in, striking out the side in the second inning.Held scoreless by Arrieta through five innings, the Nationals tied the game in the sixth on Desmond's sixth home run of the season, landing deep in the left field stands.This series between the neighboring franchises marks the first time since the Nationals moved from Montreal to Washington that both teams have winning records.''I think the way rivalries start is with winning ball clubs,'' Arrieta said. ''Both of these clubs, we're both playing extremely well. ''NOTES: Jones extended his hitting streak to 10 games for third time this season. Nationals OF Michael Morse (back) is expected to begin an extended spring training assignment on Monday at the Nationals camp in Viera, Florida, manager Davey Johnson said.

"", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 6, Nationals 5: Rewriting the script - Camden Chat', ' The script was a familiar one for Orioles fans who\'ve been used to sad-sack baseball teams. Score a fair few runs in the initial innings of the game - in this case, 6 runs over 5 innings - and then fail to add on any runs even as the O\'s starter abruptly runs out of steam. The ending to that script involved a bullpen allowing the other team to continue to chip away, culminating ultimately in a walk-off home run. In 2012, the endings to all of the scripts have been rewritten. Birdland cometh. Deal with it. That\'s not to say that the game was not without tension. If you are an Orioles fan like me, you\'ve been conditioned to the losing. You expect the worst, still. The season\'s early success has not been enough to blast away the lingering doubts and the familiar malaise. Jim Johnson entering the game to strive for his 23rd consecutive save was one of these moments. The entire 2012 Orioles bullpen is such a moment. Watching them night in and night out and that parasitic pessimist inside you says, ""These guys are way overdue to blow one."" Every pitch is a tense moment. Will the closer mysteriously hit the batter with a pitch and then give up a game-tying home run? Will he walk two guys and then give up a game-winning home run? These are the things I ask myself. For those who were watching on TV, you probably also noted FOX\'s Bob Carpenter (typically the Nationals play-by-play man for MASN, as well) doing his level best to drop a jinx on Johnson by pointing out that consecutive save streak. Rationally, there is no such thing as a jinx. I know this and you also know this, but we are fans and fandom is irrational, so we also know that the fickle finger of fate is ever present in the world. We do not tempt it. Carpenter did - intentionally, we have to suspect, being that he is a Nats guy. So when Ryan Zimmerman\'s batted ball sailed out into the bullpen in left field, we said, ""Of course."" We waited, then, for the next shoe to drop. .300+ hitter Adam LaRoche stepped up to the plate. 0-8 in this series, he was ""due"" if ever a player was. Due is due. That\'s how it was supposed to go. It was written right there in the script. Johnson - and the entire 2012 Orioles - are playing off a different script, so he just went ahead and coolly struck out LaRoche, neat as you please. The Orioles are in the win column for the 27th time this year. That is a 27-14 record. Two short years in the past, the Orioles were 27-59.    I like this new script a lot better, don\'t you? Maybe it\'s not just the ending that was changed. Maybe the Orioles of past years would have found a way to only score 4 or 5 runs, but they got the six runs, and in the end, that was exactly what they needed.    The game began with the kind of frustrating missed opportunities that were so familiar to Orioles fans. J.J. Hardy tripled - thanks to a misplay by Nationals left fielder Roger Bernadina - in the first inning and was on third base with only one out. Next up was Nick Markakis, who decided to do the Markakis thing and ground weakly right to an infielder. Zimmerman did make a nice play on the grounder; Hardy broke home and was thrown out. Yes, we have seen that movie before. Many of the Orioles have also seen that movie before. They don\'t like that movie and they are doing something about it. The second inning saw the offense get right back into the game. Wilson Betemit led off with a single and was sacrificed to second, followed by a Xavier Avery walk. I get excited by every Avery walk because one of his problems was supposed to be lack of plate discipline. He has four walks in his 33 plate appearances. That\'ll do. Ah, but this is the National League. Next up: Jason Hammel. He too sacrificed, putting runners on second and third with two out. Only a base hit could score the runs. Robert Andino delivered with a single to left, scoring the runners.    The Orioles are not really that kind of nickel-and-diming team. They\'d rather just go ahead and hit some bombs. The third inning saw Hardy reach on an infield single. Markakis then did that Markakis thing and hit a GIDP ball, but he beat out the relay throw. Adam Jones promptly uncorked his 14th home run of the year, adding another exclamation point (or perhaps another dollar sign) to recent speculation about whether he should be extended and how much he might cost. 4-0 Orioles. Even Markakis got in on the home run parade for the second game in a row. He added a two-run home run of his own in the 5th, giving the O\'s their 6 runs that they would need for the victory. Say this about Markakis: he looks bad at times, but when he delivers, he delivers. He finished the game with a batting line of .258/.335/.472 on the season. We\'d still like another 30 points across the board, but his slugging percentage is up to a level we haven\'t seen since the 2008 season. For the second straight start, Hammel lost himself in the 6th inning. Is he not all the way healed? Is something else causing him to tire early? In tonight\'s start he left with one out in the 6th and two men on base. Both the inherited runners scored after Luis Ayala entered the game, giving Hammel a final line of 5.1 IP with 6 hits, 4 runs (all earned), 2 walks and 5 strikeouts. His once-superhuman ERA is up to a mortal-looking 3.12. If he settles in that range it\'ll still be better than Jeremy Guthrie ever managed for the O\'s. The old script called for the Orioles to lose, as the old script has done for many games over the first 41 games this season. Lucky for us, they have been playing from a different script, and that has made all the difference. The O\'s will enter tomorrow\'s game looking to sweep their southern neighbors. Young sensation Stephen Strasburg will start the 1:35pm game for the Nats and Taiwanese sensation Wei-Yin Chen goes for the Orioles. The old script was one full of Sunday forfeits. The new one is full of exciting possibilities. Life remains good in Birdland tonight.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

""I talked to him later in the game. He said it relaxed a bit and was a lot better. I\'m not as concerned when it\'s in the biceps.""Strasburg attributed the soreness in part to working too hard in the days following his previous start.""The biceps is fine,"" he said.

Robert Andino drove in a run with a groundout and Avery added an RBI single before Strasburg struck out J.J.

With a victory Monday, the Red Sox can return to the .500 mark for the first time since they finished April 11-11. They have not owned a winning record at any point this season.Aviles is batting .400 with three homers during a six-game hitting streak that has raised his season average 21 points to .275. His eight homers on the season are two shy of his career high of 10, set as a rookie with Kansas City in 2008.""I just try to put the ball in play, try to hit the ball up the middle and whatever happens, happens,\'\' Aviles said. ""I\'m just trying to get on base.\'\'Boston\'s slump to open May included a three-game sweep to Baltimore at Fenway Park from May 4-6. The Orioles (27-15) have won seven of the last eight meetings with the Red Sox including the 2011 season finale that knocked Boston out of postseason contention.Baltimore had its five-game winning streak snapped with a 9-3 loss to Washington on Sunday, scoring fewer than four runs for only the second time in 10 games. The Orioles also failed to get an extra-base hit for just the second time in 19 contests despite chasing Nationals ace Stephen Strasburg after the fifth due to a high pitch count.""If you came in today thinking you\'d get their starting pitcher out of the game after five innings, you\'d like your chances,\'\' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.Showalter\'s club will now look to bounce back against Red Sox starter Clay Buchholz (4-2, 7.77 ERA), who hasn\'t been shy about allowing runs this season.Buchholz\'s ERA is the worst in baseball, but his 8.80 run support average is more than a run higher than any other pitcher in the majors. The lineup didn\'t produce enough for him to earn another victory Wednesday despite his steadiest start of the season. Buchholz gave up two runs in five innings of a 2-1 loss to Tampa Bay, marking the first time in eight starts he allowed fewer than three runs.The right-hander didn\'t receive any support when he gave up five runs and walked four in 3 2-3 innings of Boston\'s 9-6 loss in 17 innings to Baltimore on May 6. Buchholz is 0-1 with a 7.84 ERA in his last two starts versus the Orioles after going 3-0 with a 0.32 ERA in his previous four against them.Tommy Hunter (2-2, 4.78) opposed Buchholz in the 17-inning marathon, allowing five runs in 4 1-3 innings, and is 2-1 with a 7.02 ERA in seven career starts versus Boston.The right-hander started another lengthy contest Wednesday, allowing two runs in seven innings of Baltimore\'s eventual 4-3, 15-inning victory over Kansas City.Orioles outfielder Adam Jones, batting .353 with six homers during a 12-game hitting streak, hit the game-winning home run in each of those extra-inning contests.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Down by three runs in the sixth inning, the Boston Red Sox desperately needed a spark to get back into the game against the Baltimore Orioles.With one mighty swing, David Ortiz launched a ball out of Camden Yards and sent the Red Sox on their way to an uplifting 8-6 victory Monday night.Dustin Pedroia had two RBIs and Mike Aviles scored the go-ahead run in the seventh to help Boston secure its ninth win in 11 games. The Red Sox are tied with the New York Yankees in the AL East cellar but are at .500 (21-21) for the first time since April 30.''It's definitely not a goal, but it's better than being under .500,'' manager Bobby Valentine said.Boston trailed 5-2 in the sixth before Ortiz hit a drive that was so obviously gone that right fielder Nick Markakis didn't even turn around to see it become the 62nd homer in the 21-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street.It was his 10th homer of the season, second in three games, and the timing could not have been better.''We start the rally afterward,'' Ortiz said. ''Somebody got to start it, right?''Adrian Gonzalez followed with a double and Daniel Nada hit a sacrifice fly before starter Tommy Hunter balked in a run to tie it, and the Red Sox were on their way.''We hit a couple of balls good early, but nothing like that,'' Pedroia said. ''That definitely jump-starts your offense and makes you feel like we can get to them.''Hunter lamented the balk, but acknowledged that Ortiz had the most telling hit.''The last inning was very frustrating,'' he said. ''I left the ball up to Ortiz. He pimped the (stuffing) out of the ball.''Chris Davis homered for the first-place Orioles, who swept a three-game series in Fenway Park earlier this month. It was the first meeting between the teams in Baltimore since the Orioles ruined Boston's chances of reaching the playoffs with a walkoff win on the final day of the 2011 regular season.''Yeah, it's a tough one to lose, but there's always positive things we can take away from the game,'' Davis said. ''We swung the bats really well tonight, made some good plays defensively. Just couldn't hang in there.''The Red Sox went up 7-5 in the seventh against Kevin Gregg (2-2). Aviles hit a one-out single and took third on a double by Pedroia before Ortiz received an intentional walk to load the bases. Gonzalez followed with a sacrifice fly and Will Middlebrooks added an RBI single, one of his three hits for the night.Pedroia singled in a run in the eighth for a three-run lead.In the bottom half, Matt Wieters snapped an 0-for-20 skid with an RBI single off Rich Hill, whose run of eight straight hitless outings ended. But with runners at second and third and one out, Vicente Padilla retired Wilson Betemit on a short fly and struck out Nick Johnson. Padilla has stranded all 15 inherited runners this year.Alfredo Aceves worked the ninth for his 10th save.After Boston starter Clay Buchholz gave up five runs in 5 1-3 innings, Andrew Miller (1-0) retired all five batters he faced to earn the win on his 27th birthday.Boston used a run-scoring single by Aviles and Pedroia's sacrifice fly to go up 2-0 in the third.Baltimore answered with four runs in the bottom half despite hitting only one ball out of the infield. After Betemit singled to right, a walk and Robert Andino's bunt single loaded the bases. Buchholz then walked in a run, gave up an infield single and issued another bases-loaded walk. The final run came in when Adam Jones hit into a 6-4-3 double play.Davis hit his sixth home run, the first in three weeks, to make it 5-2 in the fourth.Two innings later, Ortiz took over.''We got a lead and we gave it up and we weren't going to be denied,'' Valentine said. ''I thought David's home run really uplifted us. It was such a power stroke.''Notes: Boston OF Cody Ross has a fractured bone in his left foot and could miss 6-8 weeks, GM Ben Cherington said.

"", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Is ""that it?"" - birdswatcher.com', 'Last night\xe2\x80\x99s sloppy 8-6 loss to Boston has a lot of Oriole fans wondering if this is where it all comes crashing back to earth, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s fade back into mediocrity. Survey says: who knows. First off, a hard fact: the Orioles still lead the American League East by two games. (You can exhale a bit people!) But I used the term \xe2\x80\x9csloppy\xe2\x80\x9d to describe this loss; the same could be said about Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game in Washington, so that\xe2\x80\x99s two in a row. In this case, an untimely wild pitch and a balk were what did the Orioles in as they dropped game one of three to Boston 8-6.Tommy Hunter struggled again, giving up five runs over nine hits in six innings. However in fairness Hunter left the game with it knotted at 5-5 as opposed to the Orioles being down. There\xe2\x80\x99s a part of me that feels Hunter was employing the \xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9cbend but don\xe2\x80\x99t break\xe2\x80\x9d type of mentality. With the Orioles leading 5-2 after a Chris Davis home run, Boston would seemingly chip away here and there (much like Washington did on Saturday night). However the fact is that when someone chips away slowly, eventually they\xe2\x80\x99re going to catch you unless they run out of innings. Hunter appeared extremely tight out there on the mound last night, and that probably led to an unforced error that tied the game. With Marlon Byrd at the plate and Will Middlebrooks on third, Hunter was charged with a balk. Middlebrooks was dancing at third and Byrd was feinting as if he was going to step out of the box; Hunter stepped off the rubber after coming set. Catcher Matt Wieters argued briefly with the home plate umpire, however to no avail. In the 8th Mike Aviles struck out with one on and one out, however he reached first safely on Troy Patton\xe2\x80\x99s wild pitch. As a result, another run would come into score later in the inning.But I didn\xe2\x80\x99t answer the question yet; is this the end of the magical little run the Orioles are on? My answer is no. While I don\xe2\x80\x99t necessarily believe that everything is going to fall nicely into place for this team as the season goes on (apparently only certain teams get that kind of luck), there was something else that happened last night that told me a lot about his team: they fought back yet again. In the last of the 8th following singles by Nick Markakis and Adam Jones, Matt Wieters had a ten pitch plus at-bat, resulting in an RBI-single. That was the only rally the Birds could muster for the rest of the game, however it shows they didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up. After fouling off numerous pitches, Wieters easily could have decided to come back and fight another day. In fact, that\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what many players have done in past years. Five years ago given the same circumstances (save for the player recording an out) we would have said something along the lines of \xe2\x80\x9cwell, that was a solid at-bat by player X because he made the pitcher work.\xe2\x80\x9d Wieters hung in there, which is a good sign.None of that helped the Orioles last night, however it might help them tonight or down the road. So tonight Brian Matusz has to act as the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 stopper. The good news from last night is that in Kevin Gregg and Troy Patton, the O\xe2\x80\x99s only used two relievers. Matusz hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone further into a game than 6.1 innings this year, so the bullpen might be called upon to carry some of the load tonight. On the flip side, in his last five starts Matusz has given up more than three earned runs only once. Seemingly his Boston counterpart Felix Doubront appears to be in the same boat in that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t gone more than 6.1 innings this year. While Doubront has recorded a win in three of his last four starts, he also has a 4.09 ERA.Interestingly, the entire AL East now has a .500 record or better. There should be no question that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are improved year-over-year based on that, because they play in arguably the most challenging division in sports. I maintain that it all starts with the pitching, and if they can begin getting quality starts again they\xe2\x80\x99ll return to successful ways. So\xe2\x80\xa6you\xe2\x80\x99re up Brian Matusz.

People packed restaurants and bars every night. The Orioles served as the primary reason for that, and later that year \xe2\x80\x94 the beloved broadcaster\'s first \xe2\x80\x94 the team won the World Series. According to Miller, the team\'s success can help rejuvenate the city and its economy. ""It brings together people of all different races and backgrounds and brings the city together,"" said Miller, who was in town for an event hosted by the Babe Ruth Birthplace Foundation and Museum. ""It brings people in, and creates a great atmosphere downtown. Hopefully some of that can be restored with the success of this team."" var adSkipCounter = 0;  Miller returned to Baltimore on Tuesday for the first in a series of three events featuring some of the city\'s most highly regarded baseball personalities. A popular broadcaster in town, he called games on the radio then television from 1983 to 1996. Entering Tuesday night\'s clash with the Boston Red Sox, the Orioles stood atop the American League East with a record of 27-16, two games ahead of the second-place Tampa Bay Rays. The Orioles still rank 25th in the league in attendance, bringing in an average of 22,227 fans per night. Miller said he understands why the park isn\'t filled. The Orioles haven\'t made the postseason since 1997, some remain skeptical about the team\'s current success in the grind of a 162-game regular season. Miller said the Orioles don\'t need to give up valuable prospects at the trade deadline to try and make a run this season. Instead, the fifth youngest team in baseball needs to continue to build its farm system and develop talent in house. ""They don\'t want to give away part of the future for a two month rental,"" Miller said. ""The Giants did that last year by getting Carlos Beltran for their best young pitcher [Zack Wheeler]\xe2\x80\xa6and it didn\'t put them over the top. Now they don\'t have [Wheeler]."" Miller\'s children all grew up in Baltimore and the family still owns a condo in the area. He said he and his wife return once or twice during the offseason to see old friends and spend a few weeks in the city he called home for nearly 15 years. ""I do miss it. I really enjoyed it here. I got married here, my kids all grew up here,"" Miller said. ""They\'re real Baltimoreans."" Miller was controversially let go as the television play-by-play announcer by owner Peter Angelos in 1996 for not being as favorable toward the hometown team as Angelos would have liked. Miller moved on and became the voice behind ESPN\'s Sunday Night Baseball, a position he held until last season, and now calls games for the San Francisco Giants. Miller said his relationship with the Orioles is pretty much non-existent now, although he added that management asked him to throw out the ceremonial first pitch Tuesday night. He had to decline because of his commitment to the Babe Ruth Museum. Angelos said the relationship between he and Miller is fine right now, but the two have no plans to see each other. He wished Miller well at his appearance for the museum. ""A couple years ago when we were on a train to Baltimore,"" Angelos said. ""I helped him with his luggage.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Brian Matusz handed the baseball to manager Buck Showalter and headed off the mound, walking ever so slowly toward the Orioles dugout as many in the crowd of 25,171 stood and cheered.The left-hander could be forgiven for soaking it all in, because the ovation was a long time coming.Matusz allowed two hits and struck out nine in 6 1-3 innings, Steve Tolleson and Wilson Betemit both hit two-run homers, and Baltimore beat the Boston Red Sox 4-1 on Tuesday night.It was the sixth win in eight games for the AL East-leading Orioles, who improved to 4-1 against Boston this season. Tolleson homered off Felix Doubront in the second inning and Betemit connected against Matt Albers in the eighth.Matusz (4-4) threw his fastball with uncanny accuracy and kept the Red Sox off balance with a nasty, dipping curveball. In winning his third straight start, the 25-year-old allowed one run, walked one and matched his career high in strikeouts. He threw 101 pitches, 67 for strikes.After striking out Adrian Gonzalez with a wicked breaking ball, Matusz was done for the night. But the fans wouldn't let him leave without thanking him for his performance with a long round of cheers.''I had chills going through my body,'' he said. ''It's such a great feeling to see the fans on their feet like that. You know, it really means a lot to have the support of the fans behind us. It's a pretty special feeling.''Especially for Matusz, who was 1-9 with a 10.69 ERA in a dismal 2011 that included two trips to the disabled list.''I've come a long way since last year, when it was the opposite, when people were on their feet booing,'' he said. ''It's really special to be able to work as I have and be able to come back and get back to being my normal self and be able to see the support from the fans. There's no better feeling.''After starting 0-3 this season, he has won four of his last five starts.''I'm getting my confidence back,'' Matusz said. ''Like I've said, I forgot all about last year. I look at that just as a fluke.''The left-hander certainly made an impression on the Red Sox.''He was hitting his spots, hitting the corners, getting ahead in the count,'' Gonzalez said.Darren O'Day struck out the final two batters in the seventh, Pedro Strop worked a hitless eighth and Jim Johnson got three straight outs to complete the two-hitter and earn his 16th save in as many tries.Kevin Youkilis, who was activated from the disabled list before the game, homered for the Red Sox, who were seeking to climb over .500 for the first time this season. Instead, Boston reclaimed sole possession of last place in the AL East.Matusz outpitched Doubront (4-2), who gave up two runs and four hits in six innings and notched a career-high nine strikeouts.''Those things happen. Tough games,'' Doubront said. ''I just tried to stay calm and go deep in the game. Get a chance to let our guys do the job and score some runs.''The difference was Tolleson, who came to the plate in the second inning with one home run in 62 career at-bats. With a runner on first, Tolleson sent a drive over the center-field wall.''When I hit it, I said if that doesn't go out then I'm probably not going to hit one out,'' Tolleson said.It was the first homer allowed by Doubront in five starts.''Felix Doubront had his good stuff,'' Boston manager Bobby Valentine said. ''A walk and a home run and he gave up two runs. He was battling the whole way. He just picked a night when the opposing pitcher had good stuff and shut us down.''Youkilis halved the lead with a shot to center in the fourth. It was his third homer of the season, the first since April 26.Notes: Baltimore OF Adam Jones extended his hitting streak to a career-high 14 games. ...

The Red Sox won 6-5. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Sporting a lineup top-heavy with sluggers, the Boston Red Sox got the power they needed from the bottom third of their batting order in a feel-good win over the Baltimore Orioles.Daniel Nava and Kelly Shoppach hit sixth-inning homers to turn a tie game in Boston's favor, and newcomer Scott Podsednik also connected to help carry the Red Sox to a 6-5 victory Wednesday.Nava batted seventh, Podsednik eighth and Shoppach last. The trio won't make anyone forget the home-run power of David Ortiz, Adrian Gonzalez and Kevin Youkilis, but on this day they combined to go 6 for 9 with three homers, four RBIs and four runs.The victory enabled the Red Sox to finish a grueling stretch of 20 games in 20 days with an 11-9 record, and thrust them back to .500 (22-22). Boston took two of three from the Orioles, who were seeking to win a fourth straight series against the Red Sox for the first time since 1960.''The top part of the lineup has been doing so much work in 20 days, they were a little under the (weather) today,'' manager Bobby Valentine said. ''The bottom third, (hitting coach) Dave Magadan has done such a fabulous job, we said, 'Let's leave it to those guys to do it.' And they did.''It was 2-all in the sixth before Nava drove a 2-0 pitch from Jake Arreita (2-5) over the right-field wall. Podsednik followed with a single, and Shoppach greeted Luis Ayala with a drive to left.Nava and Shoppach each doubled their home run total for the season; the pair also connected on May 14 against Seattle.Valentine revealed that the seldom-used Shoppach had griped about his lack of action less than 24 hours earlier.''Let it be known he came in yesterday and wondered why he wasn't playing. He left angry,'' Valentine said. ''I like him playing when he's angry, I guess.''Nick Johnson's second homer of the game, against Andrew Miller with a man on in the sixth, got Baltimore to 5-4. But Podsednik hit a solo shot in the eighth for a two-run cushion.Acquired from Philadelphia on May 11 and summoned from Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday, Podsednik got two hits in his first start with Boston.''It's good to get back and get my first start, contribute and get a couple runs,'' he said.Wilson Betemit hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth off Vicente Padilla, and Alfredo Aceves got four straight outs for his 11th save in 13 chances.And after that, the Red Sox began looking forward to a well-deserved day off.''Amazing effort by a group of fabulous professionals who played through a lot of adversity - time zones, weather, travel,'' Valentine said. ''They did one heck of a job winning the last two series. Going home at .500 is a feather in their cap.''Boston starter Daniel Bard (4-5) allowed two runs, five hits and four walks in 5 1-3 innings.Johnson's first multihomer game since May 28, 2006, was not enough to prevent the first-place Orioles from losing for the third time in four games. With the potential tying run on second base in the eighth, Johnson ended the inning with a strikeout.Talking about his homers, Johnson said, ''Fastballs. Got some pitches. They were in the middle of the plate and I put some good swings on it.''Regarding the eighth inning, he said, ''The last at-bat ... I just couldn't come through.''Arrieta gave up four runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings. He's winless in four starts since May 2.''Well, I think four out of my six innings I allowed the leadoff guy on base,'' the right-hander said. ''When you're pitching with a guy on and no outs to start off an inning, you put yourself in a tight situation.''Baltimore used the speed of leadoff hitter Xavier Avery to take a 1-0 lead in the first. Avery beat out a chopper in front of the plate, went to second on a single by Robert Andino and worked his way home by tagging up on two short fly balls, the last by Chris Davis.Boston loaded the bases with no outs in the second but scored only one run, on a double-play grounder by Podsednik.Johnson hit a drive into the right-field seats to start the bottom half, only the third home run allowed by Bard in eight starts this season.Boston tied it at 2 in the third on a run-scoring double by Will Middlebrooks, but Kevin Youkilis was thrown out trying to score from first base on the two-out hit.NOTES: Baltimore went 12-8 over the same 20-game stretch. ...

But Podsednik hit a solo shot in the eighth for a two-run cushion.Acquired from Philadelphia on May 11 and summoned from Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday, Podsednik got two hits in his first start with Boston.''It's good to get back and get my first start, contribute and get a couple runs,'' he said.Wilson Betemit hit a sacrifice fly in the eighth off Vicente Padilla, and Alfredo Aceves got four straight outs for his 11th save in 13 chances.And after that, the Red Sox began looking forward to a well-deserved day off.''Amazing effort by a group of fabulous professionals who played through a lot of adversity - time zones, weather, travel,'' Valentine said. ''They did one heck of a job winning the last two series. Going home at .500 is a feather in their cap.''Boston starter Daniel Bard (4-5) allowed two runs, five hits and four walks in 5 1-3 innings.Johnson's first multihomer game since May 28, 2006, was not enough to prevent the first-place Orioles from losing for the third time in four games. With the potential tying run on second base in the eighth, Johnson ended the inning with a strikeout.Talking about his homers, Johnson said, ''Fastballs. Got some pitches. They were in the middle of the plate and I put some good swings on it.''Regarding the eighth inning, he said, ''The last at-bat ... I just couldn't come through.''Arrieta gave up four runs and eight hits in 5 2-3 innings. He's winless in four starts since May 2.''Well, I think four out of my six innings I allowed the leadoff guy on base,'' the right-hander said. ''When you're pitching with a guy on and no outs to start off an inning, you put yourself in a tight situation.''Baltimore used the speed of leadoff hitter Xavier Avery to take a 1-0 lead in the first. Avery beat out a chopper in front of the plate, went to second on a single by Robert Andino and worked his way home by tagging up on two short fly balls, the last by Chris Davis.Boston loaded the bases with no outs in the second but scored only one run, on a double-play grounder by Podsednik.Johnson hit a drive into the right-field seats to start the bottom half, only the third home run allowed by Bard in eight starts this season.Boston tied it at 2 in the third on a run-scoring double by Will Middlebrooks, but Kevin Youkilis was thrown out trying to score from first base on the two-out hit.NOTES: Baltimore went 12-8 over the same 20-game stretch. ... Nava has 11 RBIs in 14 games since joining the Red Sox on May 10. ... Orioles LHP Zach Britton (shoulder) is set to begin his minor league rehabilitation assignment Saturday with Double-A Bowie. ... Baltimore's Adam Jones extended his career-best hitting streak to 15 games. ... RHP Dylan Bundy, the Orioles' top amateur draft pick in 2011, was promoted to Class A Frederick from Class A Delmarva, where he went eight starts without giving up an earned run.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Jason Hammel had just worked out of another jam when he sat down in the dugout to watch the Baltimore Orioles take their turn at bat in the fifth inning of a tense game.After a wacky stretch in which Baltimore twice turned potential pickoffs into stolen bases, Hammel and the Orioles were on their way to an 8-2 rout of the Kansas City Royals on Friday night.Hammel pitched six shutout innings, much to the delight of a crowd of 28,954. The throng included nearly 11,000 walk-up fans, a testament to the excitement the first-place Orioles have generated after a run of 14 straight losing seasons.''Outstanding crowd tonight,'' Hammel said. ''If they are backing us, we are going to feel even better about ourselves. It's been fun to see the stands filling up now. We want to just continue to play good baseball for them.''Chris Davis homered and drove in three runs for the Orioles, now 28-1 when hitting a home run. Davis hit Baltimore's league-leading 70th homer of the season in the seventh inning with a man on to make it 8-0.The game turned two innings earlier, however, because of the Royals' inability to complete a relay from first base to second following a pickoff throw.With Baltimore up 1-0, Xavier Avery led off the fifth with a walk and broke for second as starter Bruce Chen threw to first. Avery reached second before the throw from first baseman Eric Hosmer, and Robert Andino followed with a perfectly placed bunt to put runners on the corners. This time it was Andino who took off for second as Chen threw to first. Andino avoided the tag.''It's by design,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter deadpanned.''On the first one, he just outran it,'' Kansas City manager Ned Yost said. ''He got such a good jump that the throw had to be about perfect. On the second one, we had an opportunity.''Baltimore took full advantage. J.J. Hardy hit a two-run double and Nick Markakis doubled in a run before Adam Jones chased Chen with an RBI single. With two outs, Jones stole second and scored on a single by Davis.In the top of the fifth, Hammel retired the side after the Royals got runners on second and third with one out. So watching Baltimore blow the game open was quite a relief for the right-hander.''It was huge turning point,'' Hammel said.After that, the Royals went quietly.''They really took advantage of their opportunities in that fifth inning,'' Kansas City's Jeff Francoeur said. ''Missing those two tags obviously hurt.''Part of the excitement in the ballpark centered around Jones, who appears to be closing in on a multi-year contract extension. Jones hit a sacrifice fly in the first inning and stretched his career-high hitting streak to 16 games with an RBI single in a five-run fifth.Hammel (6-1) gave up five hits, walked one and struck out seven. Obtained in an offseason trade with Colorado, Hammel is one big reason why Baltimore (29-17) owns the best record in the AL.''I think he's throwing harder than I've seen in the past,'' KC's Billy Butler said. ''He was hitting 94-95 consistently and touched 96 a few times. He's throwing well.''Francoeur had three hits, including an eighth-inning homer off Stu Pomeranz. Francoeur is 11 for 21 in his last five games.Chen (3-5) gave up six runs and seven hits in four-plus innings.

Encina, The Baltimore SunThe hit that turned the tables on the Orioles on Saturday evening was one that reliever Darren O\'Day had never seen in his two-decade-long baseball career. It opened the door for a young Kansas City Royals team that needed just that opportunity against an Orioles team it couldn\'t beat in three previous meetings this season, each decided by two runs or fewer. With the Royals trailing by a run in the seventh inning, first baseman Eric Hosmer\'s leadoff slow roller off O\'Day teetered along the third base line in front of the bag, between O\'Day and third baseman Wilson Betemit, who were looming over it waiting for the ball to turn foul. That never happened. And while they waited, Hosmer turned around and sped to second with the most unconventional of doubles, a ball that went perhaps 78 feet. He stood on second with a sheepish grin. var adSkipCounter = 0;  To the Orioles, it was no laughing matter. Hosmer later scored the tying run, and the Royals manufactured another in the eighth to beat the Orioles, 4-3, in front of an announced 26,714 at Camden Yards. ""I can honestly say I\'ve never had that play before in my 20 years of playing baseball, and now I know for the next 20,"" O\'Day said. ""I was shocked to see the ball stay fair. First of all, he\'s a good runner. It\'s a smart play, for sure. It\'s a lesson learned. Next time, I\'ll get around to the other side of the ball and keep an eye on the runner, and hopefully keep him to first base."" The Orioles (29-18) wasted their 24th quality start this season -- an impressive six-inning, two-run effort from rookie left-hander Wei-Yin Chen -- losing just their second game in which their starting pitcher has gone six or more innings and allowed three or fewer runs. The Orioles remained in first place in the American League East when the Boston Red Sox beat the Tampa Bay Rays on a walk-off homer by Jarrod Saltalamacchia. Hosmer, part of a bottom third of the order that was 6-for-12, also drove in two runs, including the game-winning run off Pedro Strop (3-2) in the eighth, a one-out lazy single to left that ended Strop\'s streak of 142/3 scoreless innings. ""We knew we were going to have to score some more runs,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ""Just a fine line there. They were due for some things to go their way. We battled. We had some opportunities. The bullpen pitched well, if you look at what they actually gave up."" After taking a 3-0 lead in the third inning -- highlighted by solo homers by Chris Davis and J.J. Hardy -- the Orioles couldn\'t muster any offense. They stranded nine base runners and had the leadoff batter on base in four of the final six innings, but only one runner reached second base in that span. ""As good as our bullpen has been, you can\'t expect them to pull that weight all season,"" said Davis, who hit his second homer in as many days with an opposite-field shot to left in the second inning. ""There\'s got to be times when we go out there, like [Friday] night, and give our pitchers a six-run cushion, you know, something to work with. You can\'t expect those guys to come out there every day and pitch in a one-run game."" Chen, who left the game with a 3-2 lead, gave the Orioles the chance to win, giving the club his fifth quality start, including four at Camden Yards. Take away his last start, a forgettable 41/3-inning, six-run outing in Washington, and Chen has allowed three or fewer runs in each of his other eight starts. The Orioles, who were stymied by Royals starter Felipe Paulino on May 16 to the tune of seven shutout innings, got to the 28-year-old right-hander with a pair of early solo home runs. Davis took a 1-0 curveball from Paulino the opposite way to left-center field to give the Orioles a 1-0 lead. In the third, Hardy hit his 10th homer of the season, putting a 94 mph fastball into the left-field stands. Two batters later, Adam Jones tripled into right-center field, then came in to score on Matt Wieters\' sacrifice fly to deep center. In a tie game in the eighth, Strop, who had made 13 straight scoreless appearances, yielded a leadoff single to cleanup hitter Mike Moustakas, then issued a one-out walk to Alex Gordon and a single to Johnny Giavotella to load the bases. Hosmer then singled to left just in front of Xavier Avery -- his second RBI of the day -- to give Kansas City a 4-3 lead. With the bases still loaded, Strop recovered, striking out Humberto Quintero and getting Mitch Maier to ground out to second. Orioles designated hitter Nick Johnson just missed a two-run homer in the eighth that would have regained the lead late, but it was wide of the right-field foul pole by about five feet. After Hosmer\'s double off O\'Day, Quintero doubled down the right-field line to drive in Hosmer and tie the game at 3. Maier -- in for starting center fielder Jarrod Dyson, who came out of the game with a right hamstring contusion after a collision with left fielder Gordon -- hit a single that dropped behind third base in front of Avery.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

I fit here on this team. I fit in Camden Yards. I don\'t see myself wearing another white uniform that doesn\'t have Orioles across the chest,"" said Jones, a native of San Diego.""I\'m not from Baltimore. This is now my town.""A fan favorite, Jones entered Sunday with a 17-game hitting streak and leads the team in home runs and RBIs.Vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette began negotiating a new deal with the 2009 All-Star weeks ago.Jones\' new deal includes a $2 million signing bonus, $8.5 million in 2013, $13 million each in 2014 and 2015, $16 million apiece in 2016 and 2017 and $17 million in 2018. It also includes a no-trade provision.""The dude rang the cash register every time he hit a home run,"" Duquette said.After the Orioles and Jones agreed on a one-year, $6.15 million contract in February, avoiding arbitration, they began exploring an extension.""We started the process in spring training, and picked up some steam in the last couple of weeks,"" Duquette said.Jones has been active in community affairs, something that Duquette referred to several times during Sunday\'s announcement.""To have a great team in Baltimore, you have to find and keep players like Adam,"" Duquette said.The news conference was attended by a local youth baseball team that Jones sponsors.""A lot of these kids look up to me, and I am a role model,"" Jones said.Jones had one more year before he could have been a free agent, and he acknowledged he decided he wanted to stay in Baltimore some time ago.""Now, I don\'t have to worry about trade deadline, free agency,"" Jones said. ""I don\'t have to worry about any of that, just worry about being a part of the best team in baseball.""The Orioles have suffered through 14 straight losing seasons, and since Jones came to Baltimore in a trade from Seattle in 2008, the team hasn\'t won even 70 games. Entering Sunday\'s game with Kansas City, the Orioles lead the AL East with a 29-18 record.""We have to prove to the fans that we\'re for real. We\'re slowing doing it. This is a big step in that right direction,"" Jones said.""There\'s a bigger goal here, I believe, and that\'s winning games.""

Oh, you were pumped before it started, weren\'t you? Your team was all alone in first place in the American League East. You were part of a great crowd (an announced 33,919) in a wonderful setting, with thousands of Little Leaguers parading around the field and the Orioles wearing camouflage uniforms for Military Appreciation Day. (Baseball players in camo -- George Carlin would have a field day with that one.) Not to mention you were still buzzed from the news the Orioles had locked up star center fielder Adam Jones for the next six years. var adSkipCounter = 0;  Maybe you dared to think: ""This is what Orioles baseball should be. Right here, right now, it\'s about as perfect as you could hope for."" Then a little more than three hours later, your mood shifted, didn\'t it? Gloom set in. Oh, not heavy-duty, throw-yourself-off-a-cliff gloom. But the Orioles\' 4-2 loss to the last-place Royals -- their second in a row to a bad Kansas City team -- definitely took a lot of the joy out of the place. Was it cause for concern? Maybe. Sure, the Orioles are still tied for first place in the division this morning. But it\'s just as clear this team has officially hit a rough patch, losing five of its past seven as it starts a big three-game series tonight in Toronto, part of a nine-game road trip that moves on to Tampa Bay and Boston. Still, if you were an Orioles fan who wanted to stay focused on the positive Sunday, the Adam Jones extension was huge. For an Orioles team that\'s been tone-deaf for years in the public relations department, signing the popular center fielder was definitely a sign that management was listening -- finally -- to the fans. ""I think it\'s important that Orioles fans know we\'re committed to having a winning team,"" executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette said when the club made Jones\' signing official. ""And one of the keys to having a winning team year in and year out is having players in your lineup that are dependable that can stabilize your team. So Adam Jones stablizes our team. ""... He hits in the middle of the lineup. He uses his speed to put pressure on the other teams offensively, and he helps stablilize our pitching staff by patrolling center field at an elite level. ""... So we\'re telling Orioles fans we\'re committed to this player, we\'re committed to putting a winning team on the field and we\'re committed to providing hope to building our fan base."" Hope is exactly what Orioles fans need after 14 straight losing seasons, of course. But let\'s not kid ourselves. If the Orioles had gotten off to another train wreck of a spring, the Jones contract extension would have never happened -- at least not this early in the season. And if Jones himself weren\'t off to a red-hot start -- .308 batting average, 14homers, 31 RBIs, a career-high 18-game hitting streak -- the deal would have never gone down, either. ""They\'d probably want to get rid of me,"" he joked the other day. But as I wandered around Camden Yards on Sunday, the fans I spoke to didn\'t seem to care about the machinations behind the extension. ""I think it\'s great,"" said Rocky Arocho of Baltimore. ""I think it\'s going to bring a lot to Baltimore. I think the team needs someone to rally around, and he might be the guy."" Then Arocho paused and smiled. ""Of course, we\'ll see how he\'s doing in August,"" Arocho said. ""We\'ll see how the team\'s doing, too."" Yep, there was the famous fatalism of Orioles fans at work. And who could blame Arocho for thinking that way? It\'s what so many fans have done for the first two months of the season: rooted for the Orioles with cautious optimism while wondering whether this team would collapse in August and September, as so many Orioles teams have. This is an entire region waiting for the other shoe to drop. But Ken Katz of Columbia said it seemed the Orioles were moving in the right direction with their recent signings. ""I\'m more optimistic because they have a very good corps of young players they\'ve locked up,"" he said, referring to Jones, shortstop J.J. Hardy, right fielder Nick Markakis and catcher Matt Wieters, who\'s not eligible for free agency until the end of the 2015 season. Then he pointed to his son, Jordan, a ninth-grader at Hammond High in Howard County, and said: ""He\'s never seen a winning Orioles team."" Maybe he\'ll see one this year, maybe he won\'t. But at least this year, Jordan said, he\'s not taking the same abuse he took in the past for being an Orioles fan. ""I used to get: \'You should be rooting for the Red Sox or the Yankees because the Orioles [stink],"" he said. And now? ""I\'m getting it significantly less,"" Jordan said. The Katz\'s take that as a sign of progress. The Orioles probably should, too. kevin.cowherd@baltsun.com twitter.com/kevincowherdsun Listen to Kevin Cowherd Tuesdays at 7:20 a.m. on 105.7 The Fan\'s ""The Norris and Davis Show.""      window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Aaron Vincent Elkaim)MoreTORONTO (AP) Tommy Hunter is struggling, and Toronto was the last place he wanted to pitch. As usual, things didn't work out too well for him north of the border.Hunter gave up six runs in three-plus innings, including two-run homers to Edwin Encarnacion and Kelly Johnson, and the Blue Jays beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-2 Monday night to end a five-game losing streak.Winless in six starts since beating the Blue Jays in Baltimore on April 24, Hunter fell to 0-3 with a 7.30 ERA in five career starts at Rogers Centre.''This place is sickening for me,'' he said.The Orioles have lost three straight and six of eight. They remained tied with Tampa Bay atop the AL East.Hunter blamed poor fastball command for his shortest outing of the season - and his recent results, adding that he's starting to become worried about keeping his spot in the rotation.''As soon as I can figure out how to throw a fastball down in the zone, things are going to change,'' Hunter said. ''It's a battle right now. It's one of those things where you've got to find it or somebody else is going to do it.''Manager Buck Showalter said the Orioles would ''step back'' and assess the rotation going forward but did not commit to making a change, even after Hunter put Baltimore in an early hole.''We got on our heels,'' Showalter said. ''It knocked a lot of wind out of our sails starting off like that.''Hunter allowed five earned runs and nine hits. He walked none and struck out none.Toronto rookie Drew Hutchison got the win, striking out a career-high nine in seven shutout innings.''Hutchison was good, real good,'' Showalter said. ''You can see why they think so highly of him. This guy is 21 years old with great stuff.''Hutchison (4-2) allowed three hits, all singles, in the longest of his eight big league starts. He walked three.''I found my slot, found my release point, which is something I was looking for,'' Hutchison said.

Back in the lineup after missing two games with a sore left hamstring, Johnson led off with a double and scored on Colby Rasmus' single to right. Johnson added another run in the second, driving in David Cooper with a groundout.Encarnacion made it 4-0 with a line-drive homer in the third and Johnson chased Hunter with his shot in the fourth.Baltimore got Mark Reynolds back from injury, activating him from the 15-day disabled list, but his return did little to spark an offense that has scored just seven runs over the past three games.Poor baserunning and a questionable call cost the Orioles in the third, when Chris Davis led off with a single and Reynolds followed with a walk. Davis was caught stealing when he got caught in a rundown, with third base umpire Kerwin Danley ruling that Davis had left the baseline to avoid a tag from third baseman Brett Lawrie. Third base coach DeMarlo Hale and Showalter both argued the call.''DeMarlo didn't think (Davis) went far enough out of the line,'' Showalter said. ''(The tag) obviously missed him.''Hutchison loaded the bases by issuing walks to Robert Andino and, one out later, J.J.

Adam Jones started the beginning of a great night at the plate with a home run in the second inning, giving the Orioles a 1-0 lead that wouldn't last long. After two easy innings from Arrieta that made it look like we might be in for a good night of baseball, Jake fell apart in the third. Brett Lawrie and David Cooper singled, then when Rajai Davis bunted, Arrieta threw the ball past the first baseman for an error. Lawrie came around to score the Blue Jay's first run. One more run scored on a ground out, and the Blue Jays had a 2-1 lead.  The runs continued to pour on on the fourth inning thanks to a couple doubles, a walk, and an error from center fielder Jones. He came in to catch a liner from Cooper and the ball just hit his glove and he didn't make the catch. Two runs had already scored in the inning and the error set the stage for another run to score on a single from Rajai Davis. Wilson Betemit, playing left field tonight, made an error that allowed Davis to get to second, but no more runs scored. Blue Jays 5, Orioles 1.    As Blue Jays starter Ricky Romero continued to mow down the Orioles hitters, Arrieta continued to flounder. He walked the first two betters he saw in the bottom of the fifth inning and after striking out Colby Rasmus, his night was over. New Oriole Miguel Gonzalez came in to relieve Arrieta and was after a rocky start to his major-league debut, he was quite impressive.    Gonzalez struck out the first batter he saw, J.P. Arencibia, then gave up a clean single to right field that allowed Arrieta's first baserunner to score. He then allowed two more singles that weren't as impressive, one broken bat bloop and one ground ball up the middle. After the last single, hit by Rajai Davis, catcher Matt Wieters exploded on the home plate umpire Doug Eddings. Eddings had been calling a questionable strike zone all night and after two pitches that looked like strike three to Davis were called balls, Wieters couldn't take it any more. Since Wieters is generally the sort of player to turn the other cheek, it was the most interesting part of the game. Eddings tossed Wieters out of the game and Buck Showalter took up his cause, stopping just short of being ejected himself.    With three more runs in and the O's catcher ejected, Kelly Johnson struck out to end the inning. Beginning in the top of the sixth inning, the Orioles bats woke up, but it was never quite enough to take the lead. In the sixth inning Jones singled with one out and Ronny Paulino, who replaced Wieters, doubled to put runners at second and third. Jones scored on a ground out by Mark Reynolds, and Paulino came around on Chris Davis' 9th home run of the year. That cut the lead to 8-4 as Betemit struck out to end the inning. The Orioles loaded the bases in the 7th inning but couldn't score, and got the first two batters on in the 8th and then stranded them. They finally got on the board again in the 9th inning on Adam Jones' second home run of the night and 16th of the year. J.J. Hardy had singled ahead of him and came around to score, making the score 8-6. After the home run, Paulino doubled and Reynolds walked, putting the go-ahead run at the plate. But neither Chris Davis nor Betemit could get them in and the Orioles couldn't tie the game. I haven't mentioned the pitching in awhile, but I have to commend Miguel Gonzalez. After the singles he allowed when he first came into the game, he went on to pitch 3 1/3 innings allowing just one more hit and no walks. He struck out five. It was a great major-league debut and I look forward to seeing him pitch in the future.  To avoid the sweep tomorrow the Orioles will have to get to Brandon Morrow. That should be fun.

Orioles outfielder Adam Jones doesn't want this latest defeat to end in a sweep.Brett Lawrie had three hits and three RBIs, Ricky Romero won for the seventh time in nine starts against Baltimore and the Toronto Blue Jays beat the slumping Orioles 8-6 Tuesday night.Jones hit two homers, extending his hitting streak to 20 games, and Chris Davis added a two-run drive but it wasn't enough for Baltimore.

''We need a win big.''Jones hit a leadoff home run to right in the second and a two-run shot to left in the ninth, his 15th and 16th homers. It was his first multihomer game this season and the second of his career.Catcher Matt Wieters, who picked up his first career ejection, acknowledged that Baltimore has hit a rough patch.''It's definitely been a frustrating couple of games,'' said Wieters, who was tossed for arguing with home plate umpire Doug Eddings in the bottom of the fifth. Wieters was replaced by Ronny Paulino.The bottom three hitters in Toronto's lineup, Lawrie, David Cooper and Rajai Davis, went a combined 8 for 12 with six RBIs and scored four runs.Lawrie also made a spectacular sliding catch in foul territory for the second out of the ninth inning, helping the Blue Jays out of a late jam, but it was his hitting that caught the eye of manager John Farrell.''The biggest thing for me was I thought he stayed behind the baseball,'' Farrell said. ''That's the first time in a while he's driven some balls, some fastballs that were up and away from him driven the other way.''Romero (6-1) improved to 7-1 with a 2.43 ERA in his past nine starts against the Orioles. The left-hander allowed four runs and six hits in six innings to win for the second time in five starts.After walking a career-high seven in his last outing, a May 23 game at Tampa Bay, Romero walked just one against Baltimore, while striking out seven.''I don't care what I've heard about his last start or his previous 40 starts,'' Jones said of Romero. ''The guy is nasty every time he takes the mound.''Jason Frasor worked the seventh, Darren Oliver got one out and Francisco Cordero got two outs in the eighth and Casey Janssen pitched around Jones' homer in the ninth.Jones got the Orioles started with a leadoff drive to right in the second, his 15th, but the Blue Jays responded with two in the third against Baltimore right-hander Jake Arrieta (2-6).Lawrie and Cooper opened the inning with singles and Davis followed with a bunt. Lawrie scored when Arrieta threw wildly to first, with the other runners ending up at second and third.''I had a pretty rough grip on the ball and made a bad throw,'' Arrieta said. ''That right there put me in a tough spot early in the game. I can only blame myself for that.''One out later, a second run scored on Yunel Escobar's groundout.Lawrie hit a two-run double in the fourth, and Davis added an RBI single, putting Toronto up 5-1.The Blue Jays added three more in the fifth, when Lawrie, Cooper and Davis hit consecutive RBI singles off reliever Miguel Gonzalez, who was making his major league debut.Wieters, his temper rising after several questionable calls in the inning, didn't hold back from letting Eddings know how he felt, taking off his mask and yelling in the face of the umpire after getting thrown out.''He gave me plenty of rope and that's something that's clear, you can't argue balls and strikes,'' Wieters said. ''It was something where I knew I might be going there but I still had to say my piece.''Arrieta allowed seven runs, six earned, and six hits in 4 1-3 innings, extending his winless streak to five starts. Arrieta, who has won just once in his past 10 outings, walked three and struck out five.Baltimore chased Romero by scoring three runs in the sixth.

And normally sure-handed Adam Jones had David Cooper\xe2\x80\x99s fly ball to center drop out of his glove in the fourth.\xc2\xa0 That was even uglier.But Wilson Betamit\xe2\x80\x99s botched back-hand attempt on Davis\xe2\x80\x99 single to left one batter later was so truly homely you wanted to avert your eyes. var adSkipCounter = 0; First of all, it looked as if Betamit loafed after the ball in the first place. He had plenty of time to get in front of it if he\xe2\x80\x99d hustled. But he tried to back-hand the ball and it got past him, and the result was another play that left O\xe2\x80\x99s fans shaking their heads.As for Wieters, he\xe2\x80\x99s as great a gamer as the Orioles have. Sure, he\xe2\x80\x99s struggling at the plate (.231 batting average), but he\xe2\x80\x99s having an All-Star year defensively and the Orioles continue to rave about his work with the young pitchers. Which is why his ejection in the fifth inning \xe2\x80\x93 the first of his career \xe2\x80\x93 for saying something nasty to home plate umpire Doug Eddings, might have really hurt the Orioles.Yes, they were down 8-1 at the time. But they rallied to close the gap to 8-6 late in the game, and who knows what would have happened with Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 bat still in the lineup? Not to mention the fact that his ejection left the O\xe2\x80\x99s with one catcher (Ronny Paulino) for the rest of the game.As MASN announcer Gary Thorne stressed, you don\xe2\x80\x99t see Matt Wieters get that hot at an umpire very often. And Eddings\xe2\x80\x99 strike zone seemed larger than a highway billboard for much of the game. But Wieters\xe2\x80\x99s presence in the Orioles lineup is simply too critical for him to lose his cool like that.Ugly game all around for the Orioles. The frustration is mounting. They\xe2\x80\x99ve lost four straight and seven of nine. But it\xe2\x80\x99s at times like this when good teams respond by playing fundamentally-sound baseball.And keeping their cool.We\xe2\x80\x99ll see how the Orioles respond tonight.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Frank Gunn)MoreTORONTO (AP) The Baltimore Orioles couldn't salvage anything from their trip to Toronto. Adam Jones is hoping a day off will get his team ready for what remains of an important road trip.Edwin Encarnacion hit one of Toronto's four solo home runs, pitcher Brandon Morrow left the game after being struck by a line drive and the Blue Jays beat Baltimore 4-1 Wednesday night to complete a three-game sweep.The Orioles, whose season-worst losing streak reached five games, are off Thursday before opening a three-game series Friday with Tampa Bay. The two teams remain tied atop the AL East after the Rays were swept earlier Wednesday by the Chicago White Sox.''I think this day off might be needed to let us clear our heads, relax and come out Friday with a little bit more energy,'' Jones said.After facing the Rays, the Orioles are off again Monday before opening a three-game series at Fenway Park against the Boston Red Sox, currently last in the division but just 2 1/2 games out of first.''This division is tough,'' Jones said. ''Everybody is above .500, everybody is playing good baseball.''We didn't start off the road trip good but we still can salvage this road trip,'' Jones added. ''We have six more games and we want two sweeps.''Jones went 0 for 2, snapping his hitting streak at 20 games. He hit into a fielder's choice in the first, grounded into a double play in the third, was hit on the left wrist by a pitch in the sixth and walked in the ninth.Jones had his hand wrapped after the game but didn't consider his injury serious.''Nothing that's going to keep me out,'' Jones said.Jason Hammel allowed a career-high four homers and lost for the first time since April 30 at New York.''There's some games where you get away with some mistakes,'' Hammel said. ''Today I made a few mistakes and they all left the yard.''Hammel (6-2) gave up four runs and a season-high nine hits in 6 2-3 innings. He walked two and struck out five.''He pitched very close to seven innings there and he was the reason we were still in that ball game,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''He didn't give in. I'm proud of him.''Hammel was less pleased, going so far as to suggest the Blue Jays may have been stealing signs.''When you're not locating your fastball, you're going to give up some home runs there,'' Hammel said. ''But the swings they were taking on the breaking stuff, it was pretty amazing to me. I don't think you can take swings like that not knowing they're coming. I don't know. That's all I can say.''Last August, the Blue Jays were featured in an ESPN report that accused the team of a man dressed in white in the center field seats to relay information to hitters. Weeks earlier, Yankees manager Joe Girardi accused the Blue Jays of stealing signs during a visit to Toronto.Morrow suffered a bruised right shin when he was struck by Wilson Betemit's liner in the seventh, hopping around the mound in pain. Manager John Farrell and a trainer came out to check on Morrow and, following a brief discussion, supported him on either side as he limped off the field and into the dugout, disappearing down the steps to the clubhouse. X-rays were negative and the right-hander is day-to-day.''It hurt a lot,'' Morrow said. ''My foot was numb and it felt like it was swelling up. I guess there's a nerve in there that it hit it something. But luckily it hit the muscle on the side of my shin. An inch or half an inch over, it could've been a different story.''Morrow (6-3) was coming off the shortest start of his career, chased after 2-3 of an inning in last Friday's loss at Texas after giving up six runs and five hits.He bounced back nicely against Baltimore, earning the win by giving up one run and four hits over 6 1-3 innings. The right-hander walked two and struck out eight.''I came into the game with a little chip on my shoulder after last time,'' Morrow said. ''We needed this game. It was a big win to sweep them and get back in the race. Now we're just two games back of them. That was a big series for us.''Carlos Villanueva replaced Morrow and got the final two outs of the seventh. Francisco Cordero worked the eighth and Casey Janssen finished in the ninth for his fifth save in six opportunities.The Orioles opened the scoring in the second on an RBI single by Ryan Flaherty. He started in place of Nick Markakis, who sat out for the first time this season because of soreness in his right wrist and hand.Encarnacion answered in the bottom half with a leadoff drive to left against Hammel, who had allowed just three homers in 55 innings coming in. The homer was Encarnacion's 17th, second in the majors to Texas slugger Josh Hamilton, who had 21 entering play Wednesday.Rajai Davis put the Blue Jays in front with a leadoff homer to left in the third, one pitch after he was knocked down by an inside pitch on a bunt attempt. Brett Lawrie opened the fourth with a shot to center and Colby Rasmus capped the homer barrage with a one-out drive to right in the fifth.NOTES: Markakis is scheduled to see a hand specialist and undergo an MRI in Tampa on Baltimore's off-day Thursday. ...

(AP Photo/Mike Carlson)MoreST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) Brian Matusz gave the sliding Baltimore Orioles a huge lift.Matusz gave up two hits in 7 1-3 innings and the Orioles ended a six-game losing streak by holding off the Tampa Bay Rays 2-1 Saturday.''Every time I step on the mound, I want to go out there and compete and bring my best game, but to end a losing streak is definitely a good feeling,'' Matusz said. ''It's nice to go out there and get back on the winning side of things.''Matusz (5-5) didn't give up a hit until the fifth inning. He struck out seven and walked three.''I just attacked the zone and got ahead, and the Rays were swinging the bat so I got a lot of outs early in the count,'' Matusz said. ''When you have a good rhythm and good flow, it's nice to just go out there and pound the strike zone with confidence.''Reliever Pedro Strop got Ben Zobrist to ground into a bases-loaded double play in the eighth. Jim Johnson pitched the ninth for his 17th save, completing the combined two-hitter.''You know you've got a really good one when they can close a one-run game out on the road against the American League East, and Jimmy's done that for us this year,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.Baltimore broke a 1-all tie in the seventh. Mark Reynolds, who had doubled, scored with two outs when third baseman Drew Sutton made a wild throw to first on Robert Andino's grounder. Zobrist tracked down Sutton's bad throw in right field and threw out Ryan Flaherty, who also tried to score on the play.''I rushed it,'' Sutton said. ''I didn't know how much time I had. I just kind of spiked it. It didn't work out.''Endy Chavez, mired in a 3-for-35 slide, put the Orioles ahead 1-0 in the third with a home run off Jeremy Hellickson (4-2). It was Chavez's first homer since last Aug. 9 against Seattle.''Both pitchers pitched great,'' Tampa Bay manager Joe Maddon said.Elliot Johnson reached with one out in the Rays eighth when Reynolds misplayed a grounder for an error. After Matusz walked Carlos Pena, Strop relieved.Strop's wild pitch moved up the runners and B.J. Upton walked to load the bases. But Strop worked out of the jam by getting a double-play grounder from Zobrist.''Unfortunately Zoe hits the ball right at the second baseman,'' Maddon said.Hellickson gave up four hits in 6 2-3 innings. The right-hander struck out eight and walked one.''Threw a lot of strikes,'' Hellickson said. ''Didn't get deep into counts.''Sean Rodriguez got the Rays' first hit, a double to start the fifth. He later scored the tying run on Sutton's grounder.Zobrist also made a couple nice catches, including a diving effort to take away a leadoff hit from Flaherty in the fifth.NOTES: Matusz is 5-2 in eight overall starts against Tampa Bay. ...

Well, we don\'t know yet, because the club made another move before today\'s 4:05 p.m. game, acquiring outfielder-first baseman Steve Pearce from the Yankees for cash considerations. Pearce, who was playing for the Yankees\' Triple-A club in Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, is expected to be available for Sunday\'s series finale. ""I know him a little bit from spring training,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.\xc2\xa0""Our people thought he has the potential to help us [at] outfield and first base. He was second or third in the International League in hitting. [We\'re] trying to continue to do some things to offset some of the injuries, and hopefully he\'ll help."" To make room for Pearce, the Orioles designated infielder-outfielder Bill Hall for assignment for the second time in nine days. Pearce was hitting .321/.422/.574 with 11 homers and 30 RBI in 52 games with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. He was eligible to opt out of his contract, and the amount of money exchanged to add Pearce was miniscule. var adSkipCounter = 0;  The 28-year-old spent parts of five big-league seasons with the Pirates, hitting\xc2\xa0.232/.302/.366 with nine homers and 52 RBI in 185 games. With the Orioles in need of outfield depth, the club believed bringing in Pearce was a better option than some of the existing ones in Triple-A Norfolk, which include Lew Ford, Jamie Hoffmann and Jai Miller. The Orioles also want to keep 22-year-old rookie Xavier Avery in the minors for more seasoning. ""We\'ve got some good options there,"" Showalter said.\xc2\xa0""Lew Ford\'s still trying to really establish himself from the Atlantic League to that level.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), ('Orioles scuffle on - birdswatcher.com', 'Oriole starter Wei-Yin Chen pitched 4.2 innings of no-hit baseball last night, walking two hitters (which were taken care of by a subsequent double play). From that standpoint this outing against the Tampa Rays was pretty decent from Chen\xe2\x80\x99s standpoint. The issue is that Chen pitched 5.2 innings total in the game, and those 4.2 great innings came after he gave up five runs in the first. It seems like no matter what you do and what you defend against, Tampa and Joe Maddon has a way to get to you. I suppose that\xe2\x80\x99s part of the moxie that Buck Showalter is trying to get to Baltimore\xe2\x80\xa6however from the standpoint of an opponent it sure can be frustrating at times.Tampa seemed to be a step ahead of Chen and the Orioles in that first inning. The table was set at the very beginning when Carlos Pena led off by trying to bunt his way on base. In effect, Buck Showalter called his bluff by telling his infield to continue to play a shift on Pena as most teams do. Pena ended up hitting a double, on a ball that went right over right fielder Bill Hall\xe2\x80\x99s head. (Whether or not Nick Markakis would have had the ball is debatable, however this game has a way of finding you when you\xe2\x80\x99re filling in for an injured star.) While Pena got on base, Showalter had correctly assumed that they were feinting the bunt as a decoy. What he also did (in effect by calling Maddon\xe2\x80\x99s bluff) was show Maddon that he was going to play the numbers. By that, I mean that he was going to play his infield in shifts if necessary to cover holes where the Tampa players normally hit the ball\xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\xa6however when you have guys that successfully hit against the shift or split the middle infielders, there\xe2\x80\x99s really not much you can do. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t play the numbers, you make it much easier for them to get on base for obvious reasons. If you do, you risk falling victim to one of Maddon\xe2\x80\x99s mind games. Then again, when 37-year old Hideki Matsui hits a two-run homer there really aren\xe2\x80\x99t many mind games to be played. Chen struggled in that first inning, and the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 pen actually started to get some guys loose when it looked like he wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t make it past the first.However the reason issue of the game for the Birds was that they couldn\xe2\x80\x99t get to starter David Price. The good thing about giving up five runs in the first inning is that you have eight innings to catch up\xe2\x80\xa6IF your pitching can settle down. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly what Wei-Yin Chen did, and as I said he didn\xe2\x80\x99t give up a hit for the remainder of his 5.2 innings. Chen was flat out impressive after the first inning. However Price was more impressive from the beginning. It seems like everyone\xe2\x80\x99s a step ahead of the Orioles right now in general. The O\xe2\x80\x99s have looked at a lot of pitches the past few games. Most of them have been strikes, but right on the edge of the black. Price was commanding the inside of the strike zone all night, and go figure, home plate umpire Jeff Nelson was giving the inside corner. (I felt that Nelson might have had an unusually large inside edge of the plate, but he was very fair over the course of the game. In fact, there were many pitches that I felt were on the outside corner that he called balls.)I know that the O\xe2\x80\x99s are trying to work counts and take pitches, which is a good thing. However again, it seems like people are a step ahead of them. Price, along with Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s starters last week knew that, and he nibbled on the strike zone. That can generally be a dangerous thing, however the difference is that Price was good at it. He had no-hit stuff for sure, and the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t record a base hit until Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 fifth inning single.The pitching aside, the O\xe2\x80\x99s still can\xe2\x80\x99t get the clutch hit, stolen base\xe2\x80\xa6the clutch anything\xc2\xa0at the moment. They looked like they were going to mount a rally when they loaded the bases in the sixth inning. J.J. Hardy flied out to center fielder BJ Upton, who promptly threw out Steve Tolleson at second base (who had tagged up at first) for a double play. This shows why you always have to hustle in this game, because Upton caught Tolleson napping on the base paths, and the umpires correctly ruled that the out had come before Hardy had crossed the plate. They also loaded the bases in the eighth, but Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 ground out ended that threat. On the other hand, they weren\xe2\x80\x99t even getting much base traffic in the Toronto series, so this might be somewhat of a good sign. However it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean much if you can\xe2\x80\x99t get them home.The Orioles will try to snap their six-game losing streak this afternoon as they send Brian Matusz to the mound against Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s Jeremy Hellickson. Matusz has had three straight quality starts despite losing last Sunday to Kansas City. Incidentally, I\xe2\x80\x99m not calling out Buck Showalter for playing the odds against Tampa. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost a catch-22 in the sense that their hitters have their tendencies for sure, however they\xe2\x80\x99re also very nimble and they can often hit against their own tendencies. And the worst part is that they know your tendencies and they can expose them. This is just a phase that the Orioles are going through, and at some point it\xe2\x80\x99ll end. One can only hope that it\xe2\x80\x99s sooner rather than later.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

""It\'s not really that big of a deal when you think about it. We\'re going to get out of here, go to Boston for a day off. Go and regroup, and hopefully play some good baseball up there.""The lineup in particular needs to regroup.

The Orioles possess the 4th pick in this year\xe2\x80\x99s draft. This years draft has been considered one of the weakest drafts in the some time. There is no clear-cut 1st pick and there are many scenarios that the Orioles scouting team has to be prepared for.Entering his 1st draft as the Orioles Director of Scouting, Gary Rajsich will look to make his mark on the organization. Rajsich is replacing Joe Jordan, who left the organization for Philadelphia, and definitely encountered his fare share of troubles on draft day.Some of Jordan\xe2\x80\x99s draft busts included third baseman Billy Rowell, who was picked one selection before Cy Young pitcher Tim Lincecum, and most recently Matt Hobgood.Rajsich has had less than half a year to assemble a scouting team and prepare for the draft; which makes this years draft exceedingly more difficult than any other year.Experts are saying that there is no aces or one starter as far as pitchers go in this years draft. There are three quality right handers that are all similar in draft stock and project as number two pitchers in the future. Then again, projections are just projections. The top right-handed pitchers are Mark Appel, Kevin Gausman, and Kyle Zimmer.AP Photo/Gerald HerbertMark Appel is a 6\xe2\x80\x995 pitcher that currently attends Stanford University. His fastball sits at 94-97 MPH. He has a hard slider and a very good circle change. The three pitches in his arsenal are solid but he has struggled with command in games. Appel has the top pick in the draft by many scouts for a while. We will see if their predictions are correct on Monday.Kevin Gausman is a sophomore pitcher out of LSU. He is 6\xe2\x80\x994 and he has a mid 90\xe2\x80\x99s fastball that he can up to 99 MPH. He has a 4 seam and a 2 seam fastball. Those pitches are accompanied with an MLB ready changeup. Gausman\xe2\x80\x99s slider is above average and has good break and he has a developing curve ball. He was a 6th round selection two years ago out of high school and some scouts see Gausman as the top overall pitcher in the 2012 draft.Emily BodgenKyle Zimmer is a 6\xe2\x80\x993 strong right handed pitcher out of the University of San Francisco. Zimmer is the late riser of the group. Zimmer has the best fastball of the group, which he throws in the upper 90\xe2\x80\x99s and throws it consistently for strikes. Zimmer also has a power curve ball in his arsenal as well as a slider and an above average changeup. Zimmer hides the ball well in a very smooth delivery to the plate. The knock on Zimmer was that his velocity decreased during the course of his collegiate season. If he can gain stamina and strength, Zimmer may end up being the top pitcher from this draft class in the long run.There are also three position players that the Orioles will look very hard at with the number four pick if they are available. They are Byron Buxton, Mike Zunino, and Carlos Correa.Byron Buxton is a 6\xe2\x80\x991 high school outfielder out of Georgia. Buxton is widely considered the best overall player in the 2012 draft. He is a 5-tool outfielder that has drawn comparisons to B.J. and Justin Upton. He has tremendous speed, which allows him to turn singles into doubles. His outstanding arm complements his plate approach. The only knock on Buxton is his power. Though he is only 18, most scouts presume that his power numbers will increase as he matures.Mike Zunino is a 6\xe2\x80\x992 Junior catcher from the University of Florida. Zunino has a great bat and can develop a pitching staff. He has drawn comparisons to Jason Varitek. Zunino can hit with power to all fields and has a clutch mentality. His ability behind the plate is above average, however he does not have Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 ability. If the O\xe2\x80\x99s were to draft Zunino he would most likely move to 1st base. He is a middle of the order bat that the O\xe2\x80\x99s have needed for some time.Mike CapshawCarlos Correa is a 6\xe2\x80\x994 high school shortstop from Puerto Rico. Correa\xe2\x80\x99s stock has risen dramtically lately, and has become to top shortstop in the draft, surpassing Arizona State\xe2\x80\x99s Devin Marrero. Correa has every tool except speed and he projects to have an incredible bat with plus power at the major league level. Draft wise Correa is being compared to Orioles prospect Manny Machado. As far as major league players go, Correa is being compared to Troy Tulowitzki of the Colorado Rockies. I know what you\xe2\x80\x99re thinking, why the heck would the Orioles draft another shortstop? This guy is my sleeper pick. If the pitchers who Baltimore likes are off the board and he is the top player on the board, the Orioles should draft him. Its not often you could have two future A-Rod\xe2\x80\x99s in one farm system. It\xe2\x80\x99s a good problem for the O\xe2\x80\x99s to have. Some see Correa battling with Buxton as the best two players in the draft.Those are my top six draft-able players for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. There are many routes the O\xe2\x80\x99s can go. He are the possible scenarios.If Byron Buxton falls to number four, then there is no chance he falls further. If available the Orioles draft Byron Buxton.Of the arms available, I see Appel going in the top two picks, leaving Gausman and Zimmer.If Zunino passes Seattle, and Buxton has been drafted I would believe that the Orioles would take him.If it is a choice between Correa, Appel and Gausman/Zimmer, it would be very interesting.Here is my Mock Draft of the first 6 picks:Houston Astros- Mark AppelMinnesota Twins- Byron BuxtonSeattle Mariners- Mike ZuninoBaltimore Orioles- Kyle ZimmerKC Royals- Kevin GausmanChicago Cubs- Carlos CorreaSo there it is. I see the O\xe2\x80\x99s taking Kyle Zimmer from San Francisco. Any of these six players would add positive depth to the organization needing a boost in talent.

Arrieta, 0-5 over his last six starts, gave up four runs, two hits and four walks in 4 2-3 innings.''Certain parts of the order, you'd really like to see him attack a little more,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said of Arrieta. ''I know it's frustrating for him, you see how good he's capable of being through spurts. But you're always going to have one inning, and it seemed like he couldn't get through it.''Arrieta threw just 41 of 83 pitches for strikes.''I'm not pitching well right now, there's no doubt about that,'' Arrieta said.The Rays extended the lead to 8-2 during a four-run sixth, aided by a pair of Baltimore errors.Wieters made an errant throw from behind the plate attempting to pick off Ben Zobrist at third. After Elliot Johnson hit an RBI single, another run scored when third baseman Steve Tolleson misplayed Jose Molina's grounder. Carlos Pena added a sacrifice fly.Tampa Bay took a 2-1 lead in the fourth when Matt Joyce drove in Pena with a sacrifice fly. Upton also scored from second on the play when Baltimore center fielder Adam Jones made a bad throw attempting to get Upton out at third.Nick Johnson pinch hit for Jones, who was hit on the left wrist by a pitched ball Wednesday, in the ninth.''I didn't want to take a chance, especially as banged up as we are,'' Showalter said.Reynolds tied it at 2 on an RBI single in the fifth. He also had an eighth-inning solo shot.Wieters put the Orioles up 1-0 on a second-inning leadoff homer. Baltimore then failed to score any additional runs despite having two on with no outs. Steve Pearce hit a flyball and both Tolleson and Robert Andino struck out.Wieters also had a run-scoring hit in the ninth.NOTES: Orioles INF Wilson Betemit was out of the lineup because of a fever. ...

(AP Photo/Elise Amendola)MoreBOSTON (AP) Baltimore manager Buck Showalter decided it was time to let Wei-Yin Chen handle things on his own a little more.The rookie left-hander passed the test.Chen scattered seven hits over seven innings and the Orioles set a franchise record with their seventh straight victory in Boston, beating the Red Sox 2-1 on Wednesday night.Chen's most important inning was the seventh, when Boston had runners on second and third after a pair of singles and a sacrifice. He struck out Marlon Byrd and got Mike Aviles to pop up to short right, escaping the jam.''He'd pitched too effectively not to let him decide his own fate,'' Showalter said.Chen, the first Taiwanese-born player in Orioles history, is slowly building a nice season. He understood the faith his manager showed.''I really appreciate that Buck trusted me,'' Chen said through a translator. ''That's the key point.''And the Orioles, who moved into sole possession of first place in the AL East, made another point that they're proving to be trouble for the Red Sox again this season.The Orioles, who knocked Boston out of the postseason on the final night of the regular season last year, have won 12 of the past 15 meetings. They are 5-0 at Fenway Park this season.Endy Chavez, who had three hits in a series-opening win Tuesday, drove in the go-ahead run with a grounder in the sixth. Boston has lost three straight for the first time since early May.''Everybody's doing a little part for the team,'' Chavez said. ''As a team, we are playing pretty good even though we have a lot of injuries. We're playing good. We're focused and we're fighting and all together. That's very important.''Chen (5-2) was coming off the worst start of his first major league season, when he allowed five first-inning runs Friday in a loss to Tampa Bay. This time he struck out four, didn't walk anyone and stranded six runners.Josh Beckett (4-6) was the tough-luck loser, allowing two runs, five hits and striking out five in eight innings. It was the fifth consecutive start he's pitched at least seven innings.''I learned a lot from him tonight,'' Chen said of going against Beckett. ''I haven't had a win in a long time. It was a relief to me.''Chen went 0-2 with a no-decision in his previous three starts.Aviles thought Boston's best shot came in the seventh.''Yeah, that's exactly what it came down to. Their pitchers basically outpitched our hitters,'' he said. ''It was a great-pitched ballgame all around. Josh pitched unbelievably well and he definitely deserved to win and unfortunately we weren't able to back him up with the bats.''Beckett declined to talk to reporters.Jim Johnson, who had his first blown save of the season Tuesday after converting 25 straight chances dating to last year, got three outs for his 18th save. The first batter he retired was Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who hit a tying, two-run homer one night earlier.Trailing 1-0 and with just a single in the first five innings, the Orioles opened the sixth with three consecutive hits and took the lead with two runs. Robert Andino had an RBI single after Wilson Betemit and Ryan Flaherty singled. Chavez's fielder's choice made it 2-1.The Red Sox grabbed a 1-0 lead in the third when Darnell McDonald doubled off the Green Monster, advanced on Marlon Byrd's single and scored on Mike Aviles' sacrifice fly.Chen allowed hits in every inning except the first, but kept the damage to a minimum.With help from third baseman Will Middlebrooks, who made a diving grab of Mark Reynolds' second-inning liner, Beckett retired the first nine batters on 29 pitches, fanning three.Beckett faced the minimum and held the Orioles to one runner through the first five innings - Chavez's single leading off the fourth. Chavez was erased when J.J. Hardy bounced into a double play.NOTES: The Orioles signed 49-year-old LHP Jamie Moyer to a minor league deal and assigned him to Triple-A Norfolk. He is expected to start Saturday against Buffalo. Showalter said Moyer will get ''two or three starts down there and we'll see what happens.'' Moyer became the oldest pitcher to win as a starter when he earned a victory with Colorado in April. ... Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said RHP Daisuke Matsuzaka will start Saturday against Washington, one day before the one-year anniversary of his Tommy John surgery. Matsuzaka made eight rehab starts and is taking the spot of Daniel Bard, sent to Triple-A Pawtucket on Tuesday. Bard, a converted reliever, is 5-6 with a 5.24 ERA. ... The Orioles selected Cal Ripken Jr.'s son, Ryan, in the 20th round of the draft. ''That was pretty cool,'' Showalter said. ''This kid's got a chance to be a player. He's an outstanding prospect.'' The 6-foot-6 Ryan Ripken played at the Gilmon School in Baltimore. ...

(AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)MoreBOSTON (AP) The Boston Red Sox got off to a fast start Thursday night, building a six-run cushion for Clay Buchholz.The right-hander only needed one.Buchholz pitched a four-hitter for his third career shutout, leading the Red Sox to a 7-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles.The 27-year-old Buchholz (6-2) struck out six and walked one, throwing 125 pitches while shutting out the Orioles once again. All three of his shutouts have come against Baltimore.''Clay came out, had all his pitches right from the get-go,'' Boston manager Bobby Valentine said. ''He's getting ahead of hitters and his ball's moving so much, a lot of hitters are swinging early in the count because they don't want to get behind with that curveball that he has.''Buchholz was around the plate all night, but the Orioles couldn't get anything going offensively. He threw 78 strikes and didn't walk a batter until the ninth.It was a markedly different performance from his two previous starts this season against Baltimore, which scored five runs on him both times.''I don't know. They sort of gave it to me the last two times I've faced them,'' Buchholz said. ''You face these guys a lot. All of our starters do. It's like a chess match sort of.''Buchholz, who was limited to just 14 starts last season because of a stress fracture in his lower back, was two pitches shy of his career high. It was his first complete game since a five-hitter in an 11-0 win at Baltimore on June 4, 2010, and No. 4 overall.His only other shutout was a 10-0 victory in a no-hitter on Sept. 1, 2007, in his second big league start and appearance.Baltimore went without a hit between Ryan Flaherty's single leading off the third and Wilson Betemit's single starting the eighth. Fans gave Buchholz got a standing ovation before Chris Davis' game-ending flyout.''He did a good job keeping us off balance and throwing strikes. It seemed like every hitter, he was ahead,'' Davis said. ''We did a good job of working the counts. He was just good. He wasn't giving in. He was putting us away with all three of his pitches.''Adrian Gonzalez had three hits and two RBIs as Boston stopped a three-game losing streak. The Orioles had been 5-0 at Fenway Park this year, but couldn't recover after allowing two runs in each of the first three innings.''That was big for us to get ahead in the game and Buchholz took care of the rest,'' Gonzalez said. ''We needed that win - especially against Baltimore here at home.''Daniel Nava had two hits, walked twice and drove in two for the Red Sox (29-28), who avoided falling below .500 for the first time since they were 23-24 following a loss to Tampa Bay on May 27.Baltimore's Brian Matusz (5-6) lasted just six outs in his shortest outing since Sept. 19, also at Fenway Park. He gave up five runs, four earned, and four hits. He also issued five walks while throwing 67 pitches.Boston avoided what would have been Baltimore's second sweep at Fenway Park this year.Matusz walked Dustin Pedroia with one out in the first, Kevin Youkilis singled and Will Middlebrooks loaded the bases with a two-out walk. Gonzalez doubled down the first-base line for a 2-0 lead.''I couldn't find my rhythm. Couldn't find a groove and obviously walks were a problem,'' Matusz said. ''I just didn't have good command of anything.''Boston loaded the bases with no outs in the second on two walks around Kelly Shoppach's single. Pedroia grounded to shortstop J.J. Hardy, who tossed the ball to Robert Andino for the forceout. But Andino's throw to first was off and Shoppach scored on the error.Gonzalez chased Matusz with a leadoff single in the third, Darnell McDonald doubled with one out against Miguel Gonzalez and Nava hit a two-run single with two down.And from there, Buchholz did the rest.''We just couldn't string much together with him,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ''He commanded all of his pitches. It kind of takes some wind out of your sails there in the first couple of innings when you're out on the field that long.''NOTES: The Red Sox stay at home for the weekend with three interleague games against the Washington Nationals, facing ace Stephen Strasburg (6-1) on Friday night. ... The Nationals are 0-3 at Fenway Park and the Expos/Nationals franchise is 0-9. ...

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Jim Thome felt right at home - in the cleanup spot, in the DH slot.Thome broke loose for the first time this year, Shane Victorino homered and drove in five runs, and the Philadelphia Phillies emphatically ended a season-worst six-game losing streak by beating the Baltimore Orioles 9-6 on Friday night.''You always want to get at-bats. You always want to contribute,'' Thome said.Thome doubled twice, legged out an infield hit and got his first RBI of the season. Mike Fontenot also homered to the delight of a Camden Yards crowd full of spirited Phillies fans.Beset by back problems, the 41-year-old Thome came off the disabled list this week. He had been just 2 for 20 with 11 strikeouts overall.Thome is the majors' career leader in interleague home runs. He's spent a lot of time as a DH, and figures to get plenty of chances on the Phillies' nine-game trip to Baltimore, Minnesota and Toronto.''I've always enjoyed interleague play. It gives you a chance to see different clubs, to go to different places,'' he said. ''It gives you a good chance to see where you are, where you stand with other teams.''Chris Davis and J.J. Hardy homered for the Orioles, who lost for the ninth time in 12 games.This was interleague ball, purely AL style. Boppers ruled on a night when even ninth-place batters such as Fontenot became dangerous.The Phillies hit for the cycle, and then some, in the second inning alone - a homer, a triple, three doubles and a single. Philadelphia scored six times, with Fontenot's two-run shot coming right after his foul fly fell beyond Hardy as left fielder Endy Chavez backed off.By the fourth, it was 9-4 and the teams had already combined for 10 extra-base hits. Victorino had homered, doubled, singled and matched his career high for RBIs by then.''We came out hitting, right off the bat,'' Phillies manager Charlie Manuel said.A day after Manuel said his slumping team wasn't scaring anyone, his hitters took those words as motivation. Of course, it helped that the Phillies had a designated hitter who really was a DH, rather than a bench guy.Thome's dribbler past Jake Arrieta (2-8) went for a two-out single in the first inning when shifted second baseman Robert Andino had no chance to make a play from short right field, and set up Victorino's RBI single.Thome lined a ground-rule double to right-center in the second that let Juan Pierre score the 1,000th run of his career. Thome doubled again in the fourth and scored on Victorino's eighth homer for a 9-3 lead.Arrieta, the Orioles' opening day starter, lost his sixth straight decision. He was tagged for career highs of nine runs and 11 hits in four innings.''Going over the game in my head and trying to analyze things. I'm probably overthinking things,'' he said. ''I'm just kind of lost right now.''To go out in front of 40,000 and having a whole clubhouse counting on you, then to go out there and give it up like that, it's pretty frustrating,'' he said.Joe Blanton (5-6) hung around for 6 2-3 innings and gave up five runs, stopping a skid in which he had been pounded while going 0-3 over four starts. He has allowed 11 home runs in his past five outings.''The way things have been going for me, I'm not even thinking about runs,'' he said. ''I'm just trying to survive.''Jonathan Papelbon pitched the ninth and remained perfect in 16 save chances.Davis hit an RBI single in the second and Andino added a two-run double. Davis had a leadoff homer in the fourth.Hardy greeted reliever Michael Schwimmer with a two-out, two-run homer in the seventh.The crowd of 40,459 was the Orioles' largest since opening day and was boosted by a throng of fans decked out in Phillies garb. With Citizens Bank Park sold out for the last 235 regular-season games, plenty of Philadelphia rooters made the short drive to see their team's first visit to Baltimore since 2006.When Carlos Ruiz hit an RBI single in the second for a 7-0 lead, there was a collision of sound - the Phillies fans were yelling his nickname of ''Chooooch'' while the Orioles' backers were simply booing.''It felt like a good atmosphere,'' Blanton said.NOTES: After the game, the Phillies sent LHP Raul Valdes to Triple-A Lehigh Valley and outrighted INF-OF Pete Orr to the same club. Assistant general manager Scott Proefrock said 2B Freddy Galvis has a pars fracture in his back that is ''serious.'' Galvis will get a second opinion next week. This kind of injury could require six weeks in a brace, Proefrock said. ... Phillies 3B Placido Polanco (left wrist tear) got a cortisone shot and says he expects to miss a few more days. ... Baltimore star Adam Jones is in an 0-for-14 rut. ... RHP Tommy Hunter will come up from Triple-A Norfolk to start for Baltimore on Saturday. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

But the position is closer, and because the Phillies adhere rigidly to its modern definition, they have little to show for their purchase.Papelbon never got into Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game at Camden Yards, so it was left to a rookie left-hander, Joe Savery, to face the heart of the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup in the bottom of the 10th inning. The Orioles quickly won the game, 5-4, sending the Phillies to their eighth loss in nine games.It was a sobering defeat for the Phillies, who have won five consecutive National League East titles but are now in last place, 10 losses behind the Washington Nationals. Somewhat remarkably, they have suffered seven walk-off defeats without using Papelbon in any of them.Here are the relievers who have pitched at the end of those seven games: Joe Blanton, David Herndon, Antonio Bastardo, Brian Sanches, Michael Schwimer, B. J. Rosenberg and Savery. To be polite, it is an unproven bunch.

Yet Manuel simply will not ask him to throw two innings in a nonsave situation. The save rule, and the specific requirements for it, have become so ingrained in baseball that it sometimes warps the action.In this case, it kept a smart manager from using an elite reliever against the other team\xe2\x80\x99s best hitters.\xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not going to go two innings in a tie game on the road,\xe2\x80\x9d Manuel said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think so. I definitely think that. You just don\xe2\x80\x99t do that.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Manuel could have mentioned that he managed Brad Lidge quite well in 2008, when Lidge was a perfect 48 for 48 in save opportunities through the end of the World Series. He is no novice at handling closers, and no fan of using them in tie games on the road.

Photo       The Phillies have had seven walk-off defeats without using closer Jonathan Papelbon in any of them.  Credit             H. Rumph Jr/Associated Press           Papelbon is healthy, Manuel said, and if the Phillies had taken a lead Sunday, he would have used Papelbon for the save. But even with J. J. Hardy, Adam Jones and Matt Wieters due to bat in the 10th inning, he said he did not consider calling for Papelbon.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At home, of course, it is different. If the score is tied through eight innings, it is impossible for the home team to get a save, so a closer might as well pitch. But for the visiting team to win, some pitcher must always get the final three outs. That pitcher, to the established way of thinking, should be the closer.When things turn really desperate, strategies can change. Last Sept. 25 at Yankee Stadium, with their playoff hopes reeling, the Red Sox used Papelbon for two and a third innings of a tie game that Boston went on to win. Three days later, perhaps not coincidentally, Papelbon blew the final game of the season.

The Orioles won 5-4 in 10 innings. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Given the option, the Baltimore Orioles would prefer not to work overtime.If they must, however, they intend to make it worthwhile.Matt Wieters doubled in the game-winning run in the bottom of the 10th, and the Orioles defeated the Philadelphia Phillies 5-4 Sunday to extend their run of successive extra-inning victories to nine.Steve Tolleson hit a three-run homer for the Orioles, who bounced back from a 4-1 deficit to keep Philadelphia starter Cliff Lee winless this season.Baltimore took two of three from the Phillies, including a 12-inning win on Saturday. The nine straight extra-inning victories is an Orioles record, breaking the mark of eight set twice previously.''We'd rather win games in nine, but if you're going to go extras you want to win those,'' Wieters said. ''The key is our bullpen has been able to keep teams where they're at - especially when we get to extra innings - and just give our offense the chance to get a timely hit.''After Orioles starter Jason Hammel got through six rocky innings, Troy Patton, Jim Johnson and Darren O'Day (4-0) blanked Philadelphia on two hits the rest of the way.Then came the Baltimore 10th.Adam Jones led off against Joe Savery (0-1) by reaching on a fielding error by third baseman Ty Wigginton. Wieters then launched a drive to right that hit the scoreboard, inches over the outstretched glove of Hunter Pence. The bouncing ball eluded Pence long enough for Jones to score the unearned run.''I wasn't sure it was going to go quite far enough, and it went just out of Pence's reach,'' Wieters said. ''With Jonesy's speed, you know he's going to score if you can get it off the wall.''It was the eighth loss in nine games for the last-place Phillies, who left 10 on base and went 3 for 11 with runners in scoring position.''You got to keep going,'' manager Charlie Manuel said. ''We've always rebounded by the end of the season. We're thinking about winning.''Lee allowed four runs over six innings in his 10th start of the year. The left-hander struck out eight, but his record remained at 0-3 after Tolleson's homer wiped out Philadelphia's 4-1 lead.''A cutter up and in,'' Lee said. ''Right where I wanted to put it. He put a good swing on it. You have to give him credit right there.''Before this season, the former Cy Young Award winner had not gone more than three starts without a win to begin the year.''I guess it seems to be frustrating, but I can only control what I can control,'' Lee said.Baltimore starter Jason Hammel gave up four runs and six hits over six wild innings. The right-hander issued a season-high five walks, hit a batter and threw a wild pitch.But Hammel limited Philadelphia to 3-for-8 hitting with runners in scoring position and retired the last seven batters he faced.The game attracted 45,267 fans, many of them clad in red and rooting for the Phillies. It was the second straight sellout crowd at Camden Yards and third of the season.After Philadelphia loaded the bases with one out in the first inning and failed to score, the Orioles went up 1-0 in the bottom half on singles by Jones, Wieters and Ronny Paulino.The Phillies again stranded three runners in the second, but not before taking a 3-1 lead. With the bases loaded and two outs, Pence grounded a two-run single up the middle and Jim Thome followed with an RBI single.Hammel had a 1-2-3 third but struggled again in the fourth. A single and two walks loaded the bases before Juan Pierre scored on a wild pitch. But the Phillies stranded runners at the corners, upping their left-on-base total to eight.''In the first four innings if we got another hit we'd score some runs,'' Manuel said. ''We scored four runs but it didn't hold up. We just didn't get it done.''In the bottom half, Philadelphia's lead vanished. With two on and two outs, Tolleson hit a 1-2 pitch into the left-field seats.''That was a pretty special moment,'' Tolleson said. ''That was a big spot in the game because it was tied back up, then we let Wieters do what he does in the 10th. That was fun.''NOTES: Baltimore is 9-2 in extra innings. Philadelphia is 2-6. ... Pence went 2 for 4 and was 7 for 13 in the series. ... Orioles manager Buck Showalter was encouraged by the five scoreless innings thrown by 49-year-old Jamie Moyer on Saturday for Triple-A Norfolk. ''He pitched well, statistically,'' Showalter said. ''We got some depth there if we have a need. I hope we don't have a need.'' ... 2B Brian Roberts (concussion) will finish his minor league rehabilitation assignment on Sunday and is expected to be activated from the DL by the Orioles on Tuesday. Roberts, 34, hasn't played in a major league game since May 16, 2011.

The 34-year-old second baseman, who has not played a major league  game since May 2011 because of post-concussion symptoms, will be added  to Baltimore's 25- and 40-man rosters sometime Tuesday so long as  symptoms do not surface from his final rehab game at Triple-A Norfolk on  Sunday. Up to Sunday, Roberts had played 13 minor league rehab games over the  last two weeks, hitting .263/.370/.474 and experiencing no concussive  symptoms. Roberts suffered his initial concussion late in 2010 by hitting  himself on the helmet with his bat in frustration after a strikeout.  Back with the team for the beginning of the next season, Roberts had a  second concussion on May 16, 2011, when he hit the back of his head  sliding into second base at Fenway Park. Post-concussive symptoms from  the two injuries have kept Roberts away from baseball activities for  over a year.

He connected for a double and a homer while plating three runs off lefty Bruce Chen to power Sunday\'s 3-2 win over Kansas City as the Pirates swept their first interleague series since June 2001.McCutchen was 3 for 19 over the five previous games.""It\'s just one of those things, I guess,"" McCutchen, who has a .636 on-base percentage and a 1.809 OPS against lefties since May, told the team\'s official website. ""I see them a little better, I guess. I hadn\'t been feeling that great, past few days, but I figured a couple things out in the cage and was able to pretty much put on a show.""McCutchen gets another chance to deliver against a left-hander as the Orioles (34-26) are scheduled to send Wei-Yin Chen (5-2, 3.49 ERA) to the mound. McCutchen went 6 for 9 as the Pirates took two of three from Baltimore at home last June 20-22.Another strong performance from McCutchen could give Pittsburgh sole possession of the Central lead. The Pirates are tied with Cincinnati, which opens a three-game set against Cleveland, thanks to a 12-3 run.""We are playing good ball now and we are hitting on a couple of cylinders and it\'s fun to watch,"" said right-hander A.J. Burnett, Sunday\'s winner.The Pirates have won four in a row since Brad Lincoln (3-1, 2.40) lost his last outing, and the right-hander will try to rebound and lift them to their first five-game winning streak since Sept. 17-22, 2010.Lincoln is getting another turn in the rotation with Charlie Morton (right elbow inflammation) and Jeff Karstens (right shoulder inflammation) on the disabled list, and he\'s 4-8 with a 5.61 ERA in 19 career starts.He gave up five runs and six hits in four innings of a 5-4 loss in Cincinnati on Wednesday in his first start since May 14. Lincoln had thrown 5 2-3 scoreless innings over his previous six games, all in relief.""I got gassed,"" Lincoln said. ""I haven\'t gone that deep into a game in a long time. I struggled with my location in the fourth inning, got some pitches up into the zone.""The Orioles would like to make things easier on themselves after working overtime Saturday and Sunday. Matt Wieters\' RBI double lifted them to a 5-4, 10-inning victory Sunday, a day after Adam Jones won it with a two-run homer in the 12th.""We\'d rather win games in nine, but if you\'re going to go extras you want to win those,"" Wieters said. ""The key is our bullpen has been able to keep teams where they\'re at - especially when we get to extra innings - and just give our offense the chance to get a timely hit.""Chen (5-2, 3.49) was impressive in his latest outing Wednesday, yielding one run and scattering seven hits over seven innings of a 2-1 win at Boston. The rookie from Taiwan was 0-2 with a 7.31 ERA in his previous three starts.He\'s 3-0 with a 2.16 ERA in five starts at Camden Yards. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: The Return of Brian Roberts', 'In the last of the first inning of tonight\xe2\x80\x99s series-opening game against the Pittsburgh Pirates the Camden Yards faithful will hear a series of words they haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard in a long time: \xe2\x80\x9cBatting first for the Orioles, the second baseman, #1 Brian Roberts.\xe2\x80\x9d At some point before tonight\xe2\x80\x99s game, Roberts is expected to be activated from the 60-day DL and placed on the active roster; he\xe2\x80\x99s also expected to start at second base tonight against Pittsburgh. Roberts could very easily give a shot in the arm to a team that\xe2\x80\x99s already exceeded expectations thus far. A career .281 hitter with a .353 OBP, Roberts is a true lead-off man in every sense of the term.\xc2\xa0First off, the O\xe2\x80\x99s will have to make a corresponding roster move in order to activate Roberts. It\xe2\x80\x99s unclear who will go down, however Steve Tolleson appears to be as good a candidate as any (simply because he has options). But what happens to the infield? My guess (and it\xe2\x80\x99s simple that; a guess) is that Robert Andino will see some significant time at third base, with first base and DH being split between Mark Reynolds and Chris Davis. The batting order will also have to be reshuffled a bit given that Roberts will immediately re-claim his spot as the lead-off guy. Prior to Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 injury last May, I felt that J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s presence at the bottom of the order gave the Birds a decent 1-2 punch with Hardy hitting 9th and Roberts 1st. Whether or not Buck Showalter sends Hardy down to that spot or it\xe2\x80\x99s filled with Andino remains to be seen, however Roberts will streamline the lineup one way or the other.Without going into too much detail, Roberts has been out since suffering his second concussion last May in Boston. Since then, he\xe2\x80\x99s dealt with post-concussion syndrome which has kept him out of the lineup. There were some questions back in January about whether or not Roberts would ever return when he neglected to attend Oriole Fan Fest citing the fact that the bright lights of the Baltimore Convention Center could cause him problems. However speaking for myself, I always felt that this moment would come for Roberts, who\xe2\x80\x99s been about as solid of a player as the Orioles have had over the past ten years.However questions linger about where he\xe2\x80\x99ll be once he returns. Will he still provide the same spark to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 lineup? Will he be more hesitant to steal bases based on his injuries? From a baseball standpoint, has he lost a step at 34? If any of that were the case, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think the Orioles would pencil him into the lineup. However given that he\xe2\x80\x99s been out of the major leagues since May, there might be a slight \xe2\x80\x9cre-learning curve.\xe2\x80\x9d However at some point we will see Roberts swinging the bat and yielding one of those solid smacks up the middle for a single. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a lead-off guy is supposed to do.Roberts\xe2\x80\x99 return will hardly get the publicity that one might expect of a U2 concert or anything of that sort, however it is a big deal to the Orioles and their fans. Most importantly of all, it\xe2\x80\x99s important to Brian Roberts. So many people have asked me whether or not Roberts would ever come back, and so many more have asked me if the Orioles should flat out cut him. My answer was always yes to the first one, and no to the second. The Orioles owe him too much on his contract for them to cut him. He\xe2\x80\x99d be picked up by another team within the hour, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s would still be on the hook for his salary. Regardless of any of that, Roberts is expected to be back tonight making his 2012 debut. I would expect a rousing cheer from the Camden faithful when he steps to the plate tonight.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

It was hit first major league appearance in 13 months after a suffering a concussion. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) Playing in the major leagues for the first time in 13 months, Brian Roberts probably would have been happy just to get through the game without incident.Instead, the two-time All-Star second baseman went 3 for 4 with a sacrifice fly. He also provided the Baltimore Orioles an emotional lift Tuesday night in their 8-6 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates.Activated from the 60-day disabled list before the game, Roberts shined in his first action since May 16, 2011, when he sustained a severe concussion that left him with headaches and dizziness for months.There were times when he wasn't sure he'd ever play again. Upon his long-awaited return, the 34-year-old looked like he never left.''It felt great. I actually had bad dreams last night. I had to wake up and cross some stuff out of my mind,'' he said. ''I didn't know what to expect. I wasn't expecting three hits. I was just trying to go out there, as cliche as it sounds, and try to have good at-bats and try to do something that would help us win a game.''Baltimore's longtime leadoff hitter received a standing ovation from the crowd of 15,618 in the bottom of the first inning before lining a single up the middle.He also singled in the fourth, delivered a sacrifice fly in the sixth and singled again in the eighth - his first three-hit game since April 2011.''I just wanted to try to be productive,'' Roberts said. ''It was definitely more than I could ask for. I sometimes don't have words for what I've been through and where we are now. I'm humbled and grateful to have the opportunity.''His performance was an inspiration to the rest of the Orioles, who won their third straight and fifth in seven games.''It was fun to watch,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''The guys kind of fed off of it because you know what it meant to him. I think everybody kind of felt a little anxiety for him before the game, but he certainly didn't play like it.''Adam Jones had four hits, including a homer, and Mark Reynolds and Chris Davis also connected for the Orioles. Jones is 14 for 33 (.424) in interleague play this year.Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen (6-2) allowed four runs and eight hits in 6 1-3 innings. The Taiwan native improved to 4-0 at Camden Yards and moved into a tie with Jason Hammel for the team lead in wins.After Neil Walker hit a two-run homer in the ninth off Kevin Gregg, Jim Johnson got two outs for his 19th save.Casey McGehee also homered for the Pirates, whose four-game winning streak ended. Pittsburgh, which fell out of a first-place tie with Cincinnati in the NL Central, had won its previous six series openers.Brad Lincoln (3-2) gave up four runs and nine hits in 4 1-3 innings. He has allowed nine earned runs and 15 hits in his last two starts following six straight appearances in relief.''We need him to pitch better if he's going to stay in the rotation,'' manager Clint Hurdle said. ''We have the option, if he doesn't pitch better, to put him back in the bullpen. We need to get him back on track.''Said Lincoln: ''Missing spots got me. ... They still believe in me and they want to see me do well out there.''Baltimore took advantage of two errant throws in a four-run sixth that made it 8-2. After errors by shortstop Clint Barnes and pitcher Chris Resop, Roberts hit a sacrifice fly and J.J. Hardy singled in a run before Davis hit a two-run drive.Pittsburgh closed to 8-4 in the seventh. Andrew McCutchen drove in a run with a groundout and McGehee greeted Luis Ayala with a sacrifice fly.By then, however, the Orioles already had enough runs to up their record in interleague play to 5-2. They were 7-11 last year.Pittsburgh got a first-inning run when Matt Hague ended a 1-for-17 skid with an RBI single.Baltimore went up 2-1 in the second when Jones doubled ahead of Reynolds' fourth homer of the season - all in his last 20 games.After Jones singled in a run in the third, Baltimore left the bases loaded. The Orioles also stranded runners at the corners in the fourth.Jones hit his 18th homer in the fifth to chase Lincoln, and McGehee hit a solo shot in the sixth to make it 4-2.NOTES: Baltimore OF Endy Chavez left in the sixth inning with a right hamstring strain. ... Pittsburgh needs to win the next two games to earn a sixth straight series win for the first time since 1992. ...

', 'www.yahoo.com'), (""Orioles 7, Pirates 1: Jake's triumphant return - Camden Chat"", ' Five days ago, Jake Arrieta wasn\'t good enough to be in the starting rotation any more. He was sent to the bullpen, but never actually made an appearance in a game, so when the fluke - or as MASN analyst Mike Bordick kept calling it ""tragic bunting accident"" - occurred to keep Brian Matusz from starting today, he was the next man up to go. Would he be able to manage any success in this unexpected spot start? The press box reporters all said to one another that they believed Jake would do fine tonight, because he wouldn\'t have had time to think about this outing, he would just have to go out and pitch. Whatever led them to that insight, it seems to have been correct, because Jake - admittedly against a Pirates lineup that is the worst in baseball - turned in a masterful game. He tied his career high for strikeouts with nine, a number he\'s managed four times in his career. At times the Pittsburgh hitters had absolutely no chance against him, such as when he struck out the side after a leadoff double in the second inning. Jake had only two clean 1-2-3 innings on the night, but he scattered the seven hits he allowed with one walk and one HBP and only gave up one run on the night. He would pitch seven innings on 108 pitches. Pittsburgh starter Kevin Correia did not fare so well on the evening. From the first inning, Orioles batters were keyed in to his pitches and they spent most of the game hitting lasers every which way throughout the stadium. Correia would give up ten hits in his six innings of work. Production came for the Orioles up and down the lineup. Though their 1, 4 and 5 hitters were hitless on the night - Brian Roberts taking an 0-5 with two Ks in his second game back from the disabled list - everyone else produced. J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis, Mark Reynolds, Wilson Betemit and Steve Pearce all had multi-hit games.    With that barrage of 13 hits, the Orioles were in fairly good hands: they now have a 23-3 record when they out-hit their opponents, and they are 28-9 when scoring four or more runs. They managed to get their seven runs in spite of only 1-5 hitting with runners in scoring position, with the lone RISP hit being a Pearce single in the second inning. When you get a solo home run and a two-run home run to help your scoring, going along with a strong effort from the starter, then hitting with RISP becomes much less important.    Let\'s take a look at how some of the key situations played out. Jake was on at the beginning of the game, racking up five of his strikeouts in the first two innings. He needed to get them, because he\'d allowed a base hit in each one. Giving up a hit to the best Pirates player, Andrew McCutchen, is one thing, but he also gave up a double to Casey McGehee, who is otherwise known as the guy O\'sFan21 struck out a couple of times in (I think) college. Of course, McGehee got two hits off of Jake, but none when it really mattered.    The real question would be when Jake would have his one bad inning, how bad it would be and whether he would be able to escape. That came for him in the fourth. While he got McCutchen on a grounder to short to start the inning, he couldn\'t field a grounder back to the pitcher by Pirates cleanup hitter Garrett Jones. McGehee followed with his second single, bringing up Pedro Alvarez, who hit a comebacker that once again Arrieta could not field cleanly - what would have been a fairly easy GIDP play, 1-6-3, was instead a fielder\'s choice 1-6, and Jake followed by loading the bases when he issued a walk to Jose Tabata. Two men down and the bases loaded, and the inning had the feeling of that meltdown inning that Jake always has. He got a nice easy grounder from Clint Barmes and the crowd of 23,238 could exhale. Jake escaped with no damage done there and cruised through until the 7th, which he entered having thrown 90 pitches. Maybe Jake was tired in the seventh. He gave up an infield single to Tabata, which third baseman Betemit bare-handed but held on to instead of throwing. Barmes flew out to left, but Jake hit backup catcher Michael McKenry with a pitch to put two men on and gave up a single to left from Alex Presley. Once again, the bases were loaded and you had to wonder if he was out of gas. Neil Walker grounded to first, where Reynolds stepped on the base and threw home too late for Wieters to tag the sliding Tabata. There were still two men on when McCutchen came to the plate, but another grounder to Betemit and the threat was done, along with Jake\'s night - a most impressive one, even if it was against the worst offense in MLB. The Orioles\' scoring was provided in large part thanks to Davis and Betemit. Davis came up in the first with Hardy already on first and doubled in the first run of the day. Later, in the 7th, Davis would come up to the plate again after a Hardy single and hit a broken bat fly ball that ended up bouncing off the top of the groundskeepers\' shed just next to the out of town scoreboard. A barely home run is still a home run - and those were the 6th and 7th O\'s runs of the night, many more than they would need. Even the veteran reporters were shouting at one another about how they had never seen a broken bat home run before. Betemit added three RBI himself on the day, doubling in Reynolds in the second, scoring Reynolds (who had reached third with nobody out thanks to a double and an error in left field by Presley) on a sacrifice fly, and adding a solo home run of his own. We often talk about how Betemit ""owes"" us because of defensive liabilities - he had at least one such play tonight when he couldn\'t field a grounder down the left field line that became a double. Most nights this leaves us disappointed, but tonight he delivered. He had a three-hit night and scored two runs. The O\'s are 25-0 when they lead after the 7th, and thanks to Arrieta, that\'s exactly what they were doing. Troy Patton and Pedro Strop each threw a scoreless inning, though Strop, the birthday boy, gave up a double and a walk before settling down to finish the game. I shouldn\'t say that he settled down entirely, because he relied on a fluke play to get the second out: a Bermuda Triangle popup down the left field line fell into fair territory and the Pirates runner, Tabata, was not in position to run to third after the ball landed fair. Alertly, left fielder Pearce threw in to Strop, covering third, to get the seldom-seen 7-1 forceout. With their second straight win against Pittsburgh, the O\'s have given the Pirates their first series loss after having won five straight. The O\'s, after a slump, have now won seven of their last ten and thanks to a Rays loss find themselves in second place in the American League East on this 13th day of June. The six-run margin of victory also gives the O\'s a positive run differential - at least for now. In tomorrow\'s 7:05pm game, the O\'s will be looking to get the sweep and extend their record over the National League to 7-2 on the season. Tommy Hunter will be starting for the Orioles against our old friend Erik Bedard.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Orioles 8, Pirates 6: Welcome back, Brian Roberts ...', ' It\'s not news to any of you reading this, but tonight was Brian Roberts\' 2012 debut after missing over a year due to his concussion troubles. I wasn\'t going to miss Brian\'s first game back, so despite the steady rain that had been falling all day, I packed up the boyfriend and an umbrella and headed down to Camden Yards for what turned out to be a fantastic night. While I certainly wouldn\'t expect a large crowd on a Tuesday night against the Pittsburgh Pirates, the rain drove away many who would have attended, leaving a small crowd that was an unusually high percentage of Pirates fans. I suppose they had already driven in from out of town and, unlike the local Orioles fans, didn\'t have the option of staying home and watching the game from their couch. As it turned out, not one raindrop fell once the game started and it ended up being a lovely night. A bit humid at first, but cool by the end of the game. And I\'m very glad I didn\'t miss it because Brian Roberts (and the rest of the offense) didn\'t let me down. I\'ll be honest, I had gotten used to life without Brian Roberts. For most recent games I didn\'t even think about him. But tonight, as he stood at second base during the National Anthem, it suddenly felt like more of a Baltimore Orioles baseball game than I had experienced in quite some time.       On the mound tonight for the Orioles was Wei-Yin Chen, and while he gave up four runs in 6 1/3 against a woeful Pirates offense and threw what seemed like a million pitches, he emerged victorious. In the first inning he got two quick outs when Andrew McCutchen, the only really good hitter on the Pirates team at the moment, hit a ground ball to third base. Wilson Betemit fielded the ball and while it would have been a close play, he still had a shot. Maybe he couldn\'t get a grip on the ball, but he didn\'t even throw it. Score it an infield single for McCutchen.     As ""cleanup hitter"" Casey McGehee stood at the plate, McCutchen immediately made the Orioles pay for not getting him out as he stole second base. I said to my boyfriend, ""O\'sFan21 struck this guy out! I can\'t believe he\'s their cleanup hitter,"" and then proceeded to watch Chen walk McGehee on four pitches. The bf mock shouted, ""Bring in O\'sFan21!"" in response to the walk. The next batter, Matt Hague, singled up the middle, knocking in McCutchen. After getting two outs so quickly to start the inning, things were unraveling for Chen. Thankfully he stranded the two runners on base with a strikeout to Pedro Alvarez. That brought us all to the moment we had been waiting for. As Pirates starter Brad Lincoln warmed up, the PA announcer said the words we\'ve been waiting for over a year to hear: ""Ladies and gentlemen, batting first for the Baltimore Orioles, #1, Brian Roberts!""    The crowd was small, perhaps the smallest I\'ve seen all year. But we still managed to give Brian a very warm welcome back ovation, and as I watched him take his first pitches I just felt happy. Roberts took three straight pitches to go to a 2-1 count before fouling off a pitch, taking another ball to make it 3-2, and on the sixth pitch of the bat he lined a base hit up the middle. He wouldn\'t get past first as J.J. Hardy lined out and Chris Davis hit into a double play, but just seeing him there at first, taking his lead, dancing around to get in the pitcher\'s head, it was fantastic. After his first-inning struggles, Chen settled in and looked as you\'d expect him to against an offense like the Pirates. He gave up a single in the second inning, a walk in the third (again to McGehee!), pitched a perfect fourth, and stranded Neil Walker at second after he hit a two-out double. Chen went into the sixth inning with a 4-1 lead, thanks mostly to the Orioles doing what they do best: hitting home runs. Adam Jones led off the second inning with a double, the start of a very good night at the plate. Two outs later he came around to score on Mark Reynolds 4th home run of the year, giving the Orioles a 2-1 lead. I think it\'s about time Reynolds goes on a home run binge, don\'t you? He needs to catch up with the rest of the guys. The Orioles added a single run in the third inning thanks to back-to-back-to-back singles with two outs by Hardy, Davis, and Jones. They had a chance to get more with two runners on and Matt Wieters at the plate, but Lincoln pitched around him and walked him to load the bases for Betemit, who struck out. After a scoreless fourth inning that saw singles from Steve Pearce and Roberts wasted, the Orioles added one more in the fifth inning on a home run for Adam Jones, his 18th of the year and his third hit of the night. The top of the sixth inning started with Chen\'s arch-nemesis, Casey McGehee at the plate. As I implored him not to walk a guy with stats like McGehee\'s, Chen did something worse: he gave up a home run. The ball sailed onto the flag court as I wondered what kind of spell McGehee has on Chen. Chen got out of the inning with no more damage, but I\'m still salty at how he handled McGehee tonight. In the bottom of the inning the Orioles doubled their run total on the night, putting up a four spot against Pirates reliever Chris Resop (Resop backwards spells Poser). Pearce reached on an error by shortstop Clint Barmes, then Endy Chavez bunted for a single that Resop threw past the first baseman. Pearce went to third on the error; Chavez to second. But on the play Endy strained his hamstring and had to come out of the game. As of now we haven\'t heard if he\'ll be going to the disabled list. With two runners on and no outs, tonight\'s star stepped to the plate. Roberts fouled off a few pitches before sending a long fly ball to right field. It easily scored Pearce from first and gave the Orioles a 5-2 lead. Hardy followed that with a single past the drawn in infield to score Ryan Flaherty, who had come in to run for Chavez. Nice, J.J.! I yelled to Chris Davis as he got to the plate, ""Hit a home run off of this poser!"" and you know what? Chris obliged! He sent a ball to center field that landed in the Eutaw Street seats and put the Orioles lead at 8-2. Shockingly, Chen came back to start the seventh inning. It did not go well. Two straight hits with no outs put runners on second and third, and after an RBI ground out by Walker, Chen was done for the night. He was replaced by Luis Ayala, who immediately let his inherited runner score on a sacrifice fly that Flaherty made a nice catch on in right field. That made Chen\'s final line: 6 1/3 IP, 8 H, 4 R, 2 BB (both to McGehee), 4 K. Nothing really happened for either team in the eighth inning, but here\'s something fun that occurred: Brian Roberts led off with a single, his third hit of the game. The next batter, Hardy, hit into a fielder\'s choice with Roberts being forced out at second. As Brian jogged back to the dugout, the fans behind the Orioles dugout and all along the lower box gave him a standing ovation. It was the first time I\'ve seen a standing O for being forced out, and it was adorable. Kevin Gregg came on to pitch the 9th inning and, because he\'s Kevin Gregg, tried to spoil all of our fun. After Barmes popped up to second for the first out, Gregg walked Alex Presley, then gave up a two-run homer to Walker. Seriously, Gregg? Seriously? That made the score 8-6 and Buck yanked Gregg from the game, who walked to the dugout to a chorus of boos from the stands. Jim Johnson came in to shut it down, and shut it down he did. He struck out the dangerous McCutchen and then got McGehee on a ground out, the first pitcher to retire him in the game. O\'s win! I do apologize for the length of this recap, but tonight, to me and to many others, was about more than just the game being played on the field.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

After two more seasons, they were off to Texas to become the Rangers, and Washington was left without baseball until the Nationals arrived in 2005.The Nationals, in turn, were a surprisingly competitive 81-81 that first season back. They lost lots of games in the five seasons that followed, climbed to 80-81 in 2011 and now have become one of the best baseball stories of 2012, with a 38-23 record that has them comfortably in first place in the National League East.

According to the Elias Sports Bureau, you have to go back to September 1969 to find the last time the Yankees played a team from Washington that had a winning record after June 1.After decades of dominance, the Yankees were under .500, but they beat the Senators twice in that September series.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) About four hours before the Orioles faced the Pittsburgh Pirates, manager Buck Showalter walked up to struggling Jake Arrieta and told the right-hander he would be replacing Brian Matusz as Baltimore's starting pitcher.The element of surprise might have been a factor in Arrieta's exceptional performance. Unfortunately for Showalter, it's not a ploy that can be repeated.Arrieta struck out nine over seven steady innings, Wilson Betemit had a season-high three hits and drove in three runs, and the Orioles cruised past the Pirates 7-1 Wednesday night for their fourth straight victory.Demoted to the bullpen after an ineffective outing Friday night against Philadelphia, Arrieta turned out to be the logical replacement for Matusz, who fouled a baseball off his nose Tuesday during bunting practice and was at less than 100 percent.The injury was only a bruise, but Showalter thought it was better to pitch Arrieta on four days' rest and use Matusz on Friday.Good move.Arrieta (3-8) was dominant in ending a six-game losing streak. He gave up one run and seven hits, and the nine strikeouts matched a career high. It was the first win since May 2 for Baltimore's opening day starter.''I'm not going to overthink it,'' Showalter said. ''I tapped him on the shoulder about 2:30 in the food room and said, 'You're pitching tonight.' It's kind of out of the bag. I can't do it in five days now, so that's a one-time pop.''Arrieta didn't have time to think about the pressure of trying to get back on track. And that was a good thing.''I went back to doing some things I was doing when I was successful,'' he said. ''Kind of made some things a lot more simple than they were a couple weeks ago. I wasn't thinking as much. Going out there and really executing. I think it was nice to be out there in the bullpen for a few games and just stop thinking about some things.''Now he's back in the rotation, and Showalter can only hope for a repeat performance Monday against the Mets.''He had a good outing tonight and I'm proud of him,'' the manager said. ''And he served a need we had with Brian, being cautious with him. His next turn in the rotation if he took it would be on (Monday). I don't see why anything he did tonight wouldn't dictate that he wouldn't do that.''Chris Davis hit a broken-bat homer and had three RBIs for the Orioles, whose four-game home winning streak is a season high. By taking two straight from the Pirates, Baltimore clinched its third successive series win.Betemit, who went 3 for 3 and gave the Orioles a 5-0 lead in the sixth inning against Kevin Correia (2-6) with his eighth homer of the year.Pittsburgh, which won five consecutive series before coming to Baltimore, has lost two straight games for the first time since May 22-23.''No. 1, we need to execute better off the mound.

The trio of Matt Wieters, Mark Reynolds, and Steve Pearce combined to collect 10 hits and drive in all 12 O\'s runs, and the Birds pulled a half-game back of the idle Yankees in the AL East.Tonight  marked the return of former Orioles ace Erik Bedard, pitching at Camden  Yards for just the second time since the O\'s traded him in 2008.  Bedard, of course, was well known for being terse and uncooperative with  the media, giving disinterested one-sentence answers when he bothered  answering questions at all. I always found it hilarious, but I could see  how it would irritate beat writers who need to flesh out their stories  with quotes.Well,  we have a surprise tonight-- joining me to help out with the recap is  Erik Bedard himself! Welcome, Erik! Thanks so much for taking the time  to do this.ERIK: (exasperated sigh) ""Yeah.""Tell me, what was it like to pitch against your former team?ERIK: ""I\'ve played for a lot of teams.""Well,  that\'s true, but this is the team that drafted you, brought you to the  bigs, and developed you into an ace. Any special memories here?ERIK: ""No.""Or maybe you had extra motivation to beat them because they traded you?ERIK: (checks watch)All  right, let\'s get to the highlights. The first batter Bedard faced,  Brian Roberts, lashed a base hit up the middle. Erik, how impressive is  it for your former teammate to be doing what he is?ERIK: ""I don\'t really know what you\'re talking about.""You know, Brian Roberts. He had a concussion and missed a full year for the Orioles.ERIK: ""I don\'t follow the Orioles. I play for Pittsburgh.""Let\'s  just move on. Roberts\' single sparked a huge first-inning rally for the  Birds. With one out, Chris Davis capped an impressive nine-pitch at-bat  by working a walk after being down 0-2. Bedard retired Adam Jones on a  flyout, but the O\'s wouldn\'t let him get out of the jam that easily,  coming up big with three straight two-out RBI hits. Matt Wieters lashed  an RBI single to to give the Birds a lead, and Mark Reynolds golfed a  low 0-2 pitch into right field for a two-run double.Up  next was the ex-Pirate, Steve Pearce, and he began a huge night against  his former team by smoking a double to deep right field, plating  Reynolds to make it a 4-0 game. He certainly got all of that one, didn\'t  he, Erik?ERIK: ""Yeah, it was just a bad pitch.""Specifically, what kind of pitch was it?ERIK: ""A bad one.""Moving  along. Bedard finally got out of the first inning, but not until he\'d  thrown a whopping 36 pitches and faced eight batters. It was clearly not  his night.On  the other end of the spectrum was Orioles starter Tommy Hunter, who  took full advantage of the Pirates\' weak lineup in the first four  innings. Of the first 12 batters he faced, Hunter retired...wait for  it...ALL of them. He worked at such a quick pace that he threw only 35  pitches in four innings (fewer than Bedard threw in the first inning  alone). It\'s worth mentioning that Hunter made a mechanical adjustment  and moved to the left side of the rubber instead of the right. What does  that kind of shift do for a pitcher, Erik?ERIK: ""Well, this way, you\'re further to the left.""Dynamite  contribution, as always. Let\'s get back to the O\'s offense, which  continued to pound Bedard. In the third, Wieters roped an RBI  ground-rule double to make it a 5-0 game, though the O\'s wasted a  bases-loaded, no-out rally later in the inning. No problem-- they picked  up where they left off in the fourth. J.J. Hardy and Davis both singled  with one out, and that brought an end to Bedard\'s night. Erik was  putrid in his return to Baltimore, lasting just 3 \xe2\x85\x93 innings and getting  torched for seven runs and eight hits. Erik, your thoughts?ERIK: ""I just didn\'t have it tonight. Wasn\'t throwing good pitches.""Now, what in particular wasn\'t working for you? Was it command, was it stuff, was it......um, I looked away for a second and Bedard left. OK, thanks for stopping by, Erik!*   (*Disclaimer so I don\'t get sued: Obviously, none of those were real quotes were Bedard. They were made up for the purposes of this story. But you can kind of imagine him saying them, can\'t you?) The  O\'s continued their assault against Pirates reliever Doug Slaten, with  another two-out rally. With two men in scoring position, Wieters poked a  slow grounder to the left side that squeaked between the third baseman  and shortstop, giving him two more RBIs.Reynolds  then doubled, and Steve Pearce came through with another huge hit,  crushing a three-run blast into the left-field seats for his first  homerun as an Oriole. What a shot! Steve Pearce, in an admittedly small  sample size, has looked pretty decent so far. The Orioles now had a 10-0  lead. In the fourth inning!Hunter  carried his modest perfect game into the fifth, but any thoughts of a  Matt-Cain-esque historic night were thwarted when Garrett Jones blooped a  single to left with one out. There went the no-hitter, and pretty soon  the shutout and a quality start were gone, too. Hunter coughed up a  three-run homer to Rod Barajas later in the fifth to get the Pirates on  the board.Hunter  really wore down as the night went on. The Pirates tagged him for two  more runs in the sixth on three hits, chopping the Birds\' once-ten-run  lead in half to 10-5. Though Hunter had thrown just 77 pitches, Buck  Showalter didn\'t want to risk him squandering the entire lead, and  pulled him after the sixth. Hunter had four phenomenal innings followed  by two terrible ones that took him out of the running for the Most  Birdland Player poll. Sorry, Tommy.The  prolific Orioles offense added a couple more runs. Wieters smacked an  RBI double in the sixth that gave him five RBIs on the night, tying his  career high. I\'d say Matt has busted out of that recent slump. Wieters  and Pearce (who also drove in five) were the first O\'s teammates with  five RBIs since Cal Ripken and Will Clark on June 13, 1999.For  good measure, Reynolds smacked a solo homer in the eighth off reliever  Jared Hughes, the angriest looking person I\'ve ever seen with his crazy  eyes and heavy breathing between pitches. Settle down, man! You\'re in  the big leagues. Your life\'s not that bad. Reynolds had four hits  tonight, and the Birds\' 5-6-7 hitters-- Wieters, Reynolds, and Pearce--  combined to go 10-for-14 with two homers, five doubles, and 12 RBIs.  Amazing. The Birds\' 12 runs were a season high.The  game dragged on as Dana Eveland slogged through ugly eighth and ninth  innings, but finally he got the six outs he needed (giving up a run in  the ninth) to finish it off. And with the impressive sweep, the Orioles  are now 11 games over .500.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Chris Davis scored on the play. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) The Baltimore Orioles have been smacking the baseball all over the park lately, and the best part about their offensive barrage is there's no telling who the star will be in any particular game.Steve Pearce became the latest role player to make an impression, hitting his first homer of the season and driving in a career-high five runs, and the Orioles cruised past the Pittsburgh Pirates 12-6 Thursday night for a three-game sweep.Matt Wieters had four hits and five RBIs, and Mark Reynolds contributed four hits and a home run to help Baltimore win its fifth straight. The only other time the Orioles had two players with at least five RBIs was on June 13, 1999, when Cal Ripken had six and Will Clark tallied five in a 22-1 rout of Atlanta.Pearce was toiling in the New York Yankees farm system earlier this month before Baltimore got him for cash. On this night, he was worth his weight in gold.''Taking advantage of the opportunity, providing some versatility, putting some good at-bats together in a very short look so far,'' manager Buck Showalter said of the newcomer.The same can be said for Steve Tolleson, whose homer off Cliff Lee last weekend sparked a comeback win over Philadelphia.''We've got a lot of guys who can do that. It really gives us versatility in the lineup,'' said Chris Davis, who scored three runs.Said Showalter: ''You're going to have some situations where in order to remain consistent as a club you're going to have to have some of your depth come up and make a contribution. That's been the case so far.''With Pearce and Wieters leading the way, Baltimore built a 10-0 lead. Much of the damage came against former Oriole Erik Bedard, who yielded seven runs and eight hits in 3 1-3 innings.The 12 runs and 16 hits were season highs for Baltimore. The Orioles hit eight doubles, their most since amassing nine against the Angels on Aug. 14, 2009.''Early on we were pitching really well, winning a lot of close games,'' Davis said. ''Now we're scoring a lot of runs. As of late the bats have started to heat up and the pitching has still been there. It's kind of the offense's turn to pull their weight.''Baltimore moved 11 games over .500 (37-26) and within a half-game of the first-place Yankees in the AL East. The Orioles outscored Pittsburgh 27-13 in their fifth series sweep of the year, matching their total from last season.Rod Barajas homered for the Pirates, who came to Camden Yards tied for first place and riding a four-game winning streak. The only other time Pittsburgh was swept this season was April 10-12 by the Los Angeles Dodgers.''The sky's not going to be falling now that we got swept here in Baltimore,'' manager Clint Hurdle said. ''We are looking forward to getting out of here, I can tell you that. We got wiped out here. We got outplayed for three days.''Orioles starter Tommy Hunter (3-3) retired the first 12 batters he faced but ended up allowing five runs and seven hits in six innings. He was 0-2 in his previous seven starts since April 24.Bedard (4-7) struggled from the outset in his worst outing since he allowed nine runs against the Yankees on May 28, 2008, as a member of the Seattle Mariners. It was Bedard's second start in Baltimore since being traded to Seattle in February 2008; in those two games the left-hander yielded 10 runs over 6 2-3 innings.The Orioles sent eight batters to the plate in the first inning and scored all four runs with two outs. After Wieters hit an RBI single, Reynolds doubled in a run and Pearce added a two-run double.Doubles by Davis and Wieters made it 5-0 in the third. In the fourth, Wieters singled in two runs before Pearce launched a three-run shot off Doug Slaten. It was his first homer since May 25, 2011, with Pittsburgh.''It is nice playing against the Pirates,'' Pearce said. ''It just feels good having a great game and helping contribute to this win.''Hunter's perfect outing was ruined when Andrew McCutchen singled leading off the fifth. Two outs later, Barajas hit a three-run drive.Pittsburgh closed to 10-5 in the sixth, but Baltimore got a run in the bottom half on successive doubles by Adam Jones and Wieters.Reynolds hit a solo shot in the eighth off Jared Hughes.NOTES: Orioles leadoff hitter Brian Roberts scored the game's first run and went 1 for 5 in his third game back from a 13-month layoff with a concussion. ..

Baltimore improved to 7-2 in interleague play after going 7-11 last year. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Braves 4, Orioles 2: One that got away - Camden Chat', ' From the top of the first inning, you could just feel like it wasn\'t going to be the Orioles\' night. Three hard-hit balls off of Braves starter Tommy Hanson resulted in a web gem groundout, a single to center and a web gem GIDP. There are just those nights where it seems as if a finger of the baseball gods is on the other side of the scale. We might be less disappointed in the outcome were deus ex machina involved in this defeat. The opportunities were there for the O\'s to win the game, if they got one key hit, or if starter Brian Matusz could get the last key out. Neither of these occurred, and so the Orioles must go back to their hotel rooms in Atlanta feeling like they let this one get away.Double plays have killed the Orioles offense all year and they killed it again tonight. The O\'s entered tonight\'s game with 68 GIDPs in 63 games played. That\'s tops in the major leagues by a margin of four, and they added four more GIDPs tonight to take the total up to 72. Half of the teams in baseball have hit into 48 or fewer double plays, so the O\'s are sitting with 50% more GIDPs than the median. It\'s absurd, especially when you consider that the Orioles tonight twice pulled the old ""GIDP immediately following a walk"" routine. The pitcher can\'t find the strike zone! Wait for a good pitch! Alternatively, roll over on garbage and crush all our dreams. That was the choice tonight. Before I get into more of the downers of this game, I want to talk about two awesome things that happened tonight. One of these things happened on the baseball diamond and one did not. You may have heard that Chris Davis was playing right field tonight. The last time he played right field professionally, he was in low-A in 2006. He played two games in right at that time. He had one real chance: in the top of the sixth Chipper Jones hit a ball that was diving towards the line. Had Davis laid up on getting to it, he could have played the carom, held Jones to a double and we would have said, ""That\'s what we expect Davis to do in right field."" Davis instead dashed straight for the ball as if he was defending a perfect game. He covered ground, got into position and made a diving catch. It wasn\'t the graceful, full-extension diving catch you might see on a highlight reel. He tumbled before standing up and holding up the ball in his glove. But for Chris Davis, playing right field, it was a great catch. If the Orioles won tonight\'s game, he would be Most Birdland.    The other awesome thing happened in the broadcasting booth. While they were discussing their plans for the next night - tomorrow\'s game being broadcast on FOX means Thorne and Bordick will not be on duty for MASN - Gary mentioned that he would ""probably be in an adult location enjoying some adult beverages."" Bordick, surprising all those who thought he had no sense of humor, said, ""Just remember to drink ... ... responsibly.""    That\'s funny enough, but Gary went on to talk a little about his signature phrase and about the ladies who put it on a t-shirt. This, we believe, was a Camden Chat shoutout - at a Blogger Night two years ago, 2632 and Stacey were wearing the Camden Chat shirts we made in honor of this Thorne trademark. They showed off the shirts for him and he was tickled - tickled enough, it seems, to mention the occurrence two years later. Now back to the bad parts. Also high up in the dream-crushing category tonight was Matusz. He needed to have a good outing tonight. What he ended up having was a game that those in the game thread were arguing whether or not it would, in fact, constitute the worst quality start ever, if Matusz managed to get a quality start. As it turned out, there was no need to worry about that. Though his 6th inning was shortened by that Davis catch, Brian could not close the door. He gave up a single to Matt Diaz, managed to strike out Jason Heyward, then left a pitch hanging in the sweet spot for 22-year old Andrelton Simmons, who hit a home run that barely cleared the left field fence. Barely is still enough for a 3-2 Braves lead.    There is room for second-guessing Buck\'s handling of Matusz tonight. For one, Matusz came up to the plate in the O\'s half of the 6th inning with two men on base and two men down. He had thrown 88 pitches and did not, in the opinion of this blogger, have anything approximating his best stuff tonight. Showalter could have easily put in a pinch hitter like Nick Johnson there. It seems instead he chose to test Matusz - who worked a full count and fouled off a number of pitches before striking out. Plucky or foolish? Did this effort tire him out? Does it matter if it did? Let\'s not make excuses for Brian. He was tired, but if he\'s ever going to fulfill what we once thought was his destiny as a top starter, he has to find a way to get that last out. Instead he gave up the home run to Simmons, then gave up a triple to pinch-hitter Jack Wilson (slash line prior to that AB: .167/.190/.183). The damage was already done, so Buck left Matusz in the game to get that last out. He never did get the last out. He threw 116 pitches on the night. The fourth run scored courtesy of a seeing-eye single from Michael Bourn that just snuck out of the infield. After this hit, Brian could be seen on TV saying, ""You have gotta be f***ing kidding me."" Well, Brian, that was our reaction when you gave up a triple to Jack Wilson, and when you gave up that home run, and when you tried to be a hero in your at-bats this game... After that it was only a matter of going quietly into that good night. Adam Jones lead off the 8th with a single, and life looked promising for a moment, until he got caught in a pickoff play. Matt Wieters walked and Mark Reynolds GIDP\'d. Not much different story in the 9th, when Wilson Betemit served an 0-2 single to left, followed by a Steve Pearce strikeout and a pinch-hit GIDP from Nick Johnson. That grim business related, a soapbox moment is due. Tonight, the Atlanta fans gave a standing ovation to Hanson when he was pulled from the game despite the fact that he only went 5.1 IP and gave up six walks. Hanson also surrendered four hits, though neither of the two runs were earned. Perhaps the Braves fans were feeling charitable because Hanson notched his 500th career strikeout, a nice round number. He only struck out two. This is the standard for a standing ovation in the town that saw Maddux, Glavine and Smoltz? As mentioned above, tomorrow\'s game will be found on TV on FOX, and if you\'re not in the right market, you may be screwed due to MLB\'s draconian rules regarding the online broadcasting service that you paid for. The 7:15pm game will feature Jason Hammel squaring off against Brandon Beachy.

Luckily, Jones needed no time on the DL. With Markakis out, the Orioles relied heavily on Jones, Hardy, and Matt Wieters to produce most of the runs.Joy R.

Steve Tollesen provided the pop to boost the birds over the Phillies. The Orioles made a solid pickup in outfielder Steve Pearce from the New York Yankees, who seemingly hits every ball on a frozen rope.Throughout these weeks, Buck Showalter has flip flopped the lineup seemingly every night with new players. The order of the lineups had shuffled tremendously as well with Chris Davis hitting 3rd on occasion and Chavez splitting time Andino at the leadoff spot.Brian Roberts is the player who takes a lot of pressure off other hitters. His ability to get on base provides Jones, Hardy, and Wieters more opportunities to drive in runs. Roberts has an act for increasing the opposing pitchers pitch count early, and is able to see most if not all of his pitches in an at bat. This helps the guys on deck and on the bench figure him out as well.In Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 adsence, Chris Davis has shined hitting in the 3 hole. The reason is because he is seeing more hittable pitches. Davis is now being protected by Adam Jones and Matt Wieters.

(AP Photo/David Goldman)MoreATLANTA (AP) Adam Jones had a one-word description of the Orioles' second straight shutout win:''Chen-sational.''Wei-Yin Chen combined with four relievers on a seven-hitter and Baltimore continued its success in interleague play by beating the Atlanta Braves 2-0 on Sunday.The Braves, who have lost six of seven, were shut out in back-to-back games for the first time since June 5-6, 2009. Jason Hammel threw a one-hitter in a 5-0 victory for the Orioles on Saturday night.Jones said Hammel and Chen dominated by staying ahead in the count.''It's been pretty fun to watch from center field,'' Jones said. ''The important part of it is they always started with strike one. They've been able to do what they want because they've been ahead in counts.''The Orioles, who remained 1 1/2 games behind the first-place New York Yankees in the AL East, have won seven of eight. They are 9-3 in interleague play with series wins over Washington, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Atlanta.Chen (7-2) gave up six hits and one walk in seven innings to outpitch Randall Delgado (4-7), who allowed only two runs and three hits in eight innings.Orioles manager Buck Showalter applauded Chen's ability to successfully bunt and field bunts - no small feat for an American League pitcher from Taiwan.Chen's sacrifice helped the Orioles score a run in the sixth.''It's something you work on in spring training and it could be a difference-maker in the game, and I think it was today,'' Showalter said.Chen fielded a poor bunt by Delgado in the third to start a double play that helped spoil a scoring opportunity for Atlanta.''I'm sure they were rolling their eyes in spring training as we were going over and over bunt defense, being an American League East team,'' Showalter said. ''It was nice that it helped us and made a difference.''Still, Chen is no fan of interleague play.''Not really, because I hate hitting,'' he said through a translator.Jim Johnson pitched a perfect ninth for his 20th save. Darren O'Day, Troy Patton and Pedro Strop combined for a scoreless eighth.Delgado's eight innings matched his longest start. He walked one batter and struck out six.Jones led off the second with a ground-rule double to right field. After moving to third on Wilson Betemit's fly ball, Jones scored on Mark Reynolds' sacrifice fly.''They did a good job of executing small ball,'' Braves catcher David Ross said. ''They played the game the way it's supposed to be played.''A misplay by Matt Diaz helped Baltimore stretch the lead in the sixth. Diaz ran in before stopping too late and watching a line drive by Steve Pearce sail over his head for a double to the left-field wall. Pearce advanced on the sacrifice by Chen and scored when Delgado balked with Robert Andino at the plate.Delgado balked as he tried to move from the stretch to a full windup.''You just have to do that step-off, but I didn't,'' he said.The Braves lost two of three to the Orioles after being swept in three games by the Yankees.One day after being shut out by Hammel, the Braves sputtered again as they hit into double plays in each of the first three innings.''We played well, same as we did in the Yankees series, but we've got nothing to show for it,'' manager Fredi Gonzalez said. ''We outhit them (7-4) again today and got nothing to show for it.''Showalter said the Orioles ''got some breaks here'' by facing the Braves when first baseman Freddie Freeman missed the series with a sore finger.''The only thing we need to avoid is pressing,'' said Braves third baseman Chipper Jones, who was 0 for 3 with a walk.''You'd still like to think you can go out there and score three runs no matter who's in the ballgame.''Ross and Andrelton Simmons led off the third with singles before Delgado bounced a bunt too hard toward Chen, who threw to third to start a double play. Simmons advanced to third on a throwing error by Andino at second base, but Michael Bourn ended the inning on a groundout.The third was the only inning in which the Braves managed more than one hit.Showalter said he was impressed by the play of Simmons, the rookie shortstop who in the third inning made a tough grab of a sharply hit grounder by Jones and bounced up to make a strong throw to first to end the inning.Atlanta's Eric O'Flaherty, who had been out with a sore left elbow, got one out in the ninth in his first appearance since June 8.NOTES: The Braves placed RHP Brandon Beachy on the 15-day disabled list and recalled RHP Todd Redmond from Triple-A Gwinnett. Beachy will have an MRI on Monday. ... Freeman said the swollen knuckle on his left index finger has improved ''a lot'' after he received two cortisone shots Saturday. He missed his fourth straight start. ... Andino started in place of 2B Brian Roberts, who was given a day off. Showalter said it was ''prudent'' to be careful with Roberts, who returned Tuesday from the 60-day DL (concussion). ...

I\'ve not seen a perfecto,"" said manager Terry Collins. ""(Wednesday) I saw as close to that as I\'ve ever been around in my 42 years. It\'s amazing, just truly amazing what he\'s done. To think two years ago this guy was the first guy cut from this club to where he\'s at today, I absolutely salute the guy.""Dickey\'s numbers may come as a surprise to some, but he\'s been pitching well for a while now - his 2.91 ERA since the start of 2010 ranks ninth in the majors.""I always try to be consistent. That means a lot to me, to be consistent and trustworthy,"" he said. ""The streaks and the special things that happen along the way are just the manifestation of that, of wanting to be consistent and wanting to really be good at my craft. I still have a passion for it. I\'m still looking for things to do with the knuckleball.""Dickey now tries to slow down red-hot Baltimore (39-27), which prevailed 2-0 at Atlanta on Sunday behind seven strong innings from Wei-Yin Chen.

""Kind of made some things a lot more simple than they were a couple weeks ago. I wasn\'t thinking as much. Going out there and really executing.""Arrieta seems to have a favorable matchup against the scuffling Mets (35-32).New York is coming off a three-game sweep at the hands of Cincinnati, falling 3-1 in Sunday\'s series finale. Collins\' club, which scored a combined five runs versus the Reds, has dropped a season-worst four in a row at home and nine of 13 overall.""We\'re sputtering a little bit offensively,"" Wright said. ""Our starting pitching hasn\'t been bad. We just haven\'t been able to get them any runs.""The Mets have taken five of seven from the Orioles, including a three-game road sweep June 11-13, 2010, when the teams met last. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 2, Braves 0: Wei-Yin and his BFF, the GIDP, beat ...', "" The story of today's game was, again, the starting pitching. One day after Jason Hammel dazzled us with a complete-game one hitter, Wei-Yin Chen put together a fantastic performance that resulted in seven shutout innings. The Orioles needed it, too, as their hitters weren't able to put much together against Braves starter Randall Delgado, who didn't look much like the walking machine I expected. The Orioles scored their first run of the game in the second inning with just one hit. Adam Jones led off with a double, then moved to third on a fly out by Wilson Betemit and scored on a flyout by Mark Reynolds. Through the early innings, Chen was helped out by the pitcher's best friend over and over. He gave up a one-out single in the first inning but Chipper Jones grounded into a 6-4-3 double play to end the inning. In the second, another single, only for Jason Heyward to GIDP. But the double play in the third inning was the best of them all. Back-to-back singles by David Ross and Andrelton Simmons put runners on first and second with no outs and the pitcher coming to the plate. Chen was clinging to a one-run lead and it Delgado was pitching well, so those runners were huge. Delgado bunted the ball and it went back to Chen, who threw to third base for the first out. J.J. Hardy was covering third and he fired to first where Robert Andino was waiting to make the out. With both middle infielders covering the corner bases, Simmons at second was just kind of hanging out, not on the base. Center fielder Adam Jones ran in to cover second and Andino threw to him, but it was a bad throw that went into center field, allowing Simmons to get to third. It was a great heads up play by Jones and one good throw from Andino away from a very non-conventional triple play. Chen retired Michael Bourn on a comebacker to strand Simmons.    Delgado was cruising through the middle innings, striking out Orioles left and right and looking kind of unstoppable. But in the sixth inning, they caught a break. Steve Pearce hit a line drive to left field that Matt Diaz raced in to catch but OOPS, he ran in too far! The ball sailed over his head and Pearce ended up on second, generously awarded a double. Because the Orioles were playing National League baseball today, Chen had to bat next, and he got down a good bunt to move Pearce to third.    That brought leadoff hitter Andino to the plate, playing today in place of Brian Roberts. Don't worry, nothing is wrong with Brian. Buck Showalter was just giving him a rest. Delgado started into his windup and then stopped. I don't really know why, he looked like he decided maybe he wanted to pitch from the stretch. Or maybe his nose itched, who knows. But whatever the case, it was a clear balk. Pearce trotted in from third based to make the score 2-0 in favor of the Orioles. Delgado followed that with a walk to Andino, but then he got his own double play as Hardy grounded to second base.    It was all pitching from there on out. Delgado pitched two more innings before leaving with a final line of: 8 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 1 BB, 6 K. He was the poster boy for the hard-luck loss today, that's for sure. Chen completed seven innings with a line of: 7 IP, 6 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 2 K. His ERA now sits at 3.36 for the season. Instead of going with Pedro Strop for the 8th inning as has become custom, Buck played the match-up game. Darren O'Day started the 8th and when he gave up a single, he was pulled for lefty Troy Patton. Patton was slated to face two lefites, Juan Francisco and Michael Bourn. The Braves pinch hit for Francisco, sending righty Jack Wilson to the plate. but Jack Wilson can't hit, so it was fine. Patton retired both Wilson and Bourn, then was pulled from the game for Strop, who got Martin Prado to ground out to end the inning. After the Braves used Chad Durbin and Eric O'Flaherty for a scoreless top of the 9th, it was JJ time. Jim Johnson was filthy today, with both his sinker and a fantastic curve ball. Chipper Jones grounded out and then JJ struck out Dan Uggla and Diaz to end the game. With that, the Orioles have now won four series in a row, but have been unable to gain any ground in the standings as the Yankees are just on fire and the Nationals rolled over against them this weekend. Tomorrow the Orioles head to New York to face the Mets, where they'll have to beat R.A. Dickey and/or Johan Santana if they want to make it five series wins in a row.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He manhandled the Baltimore Orioles for 2 hours 7 minutes to carry the Mets to a 5-0 win at Citi Field.The Mets were desperate for a win after being swept by the Cincinnati Reds over the weekend in inglorious fashion, scoring five runs. They acknowledged that continued poor play would be disastrous this week, when they are hosting the Orioles and the Yankees.For the second game in a row, Dickey (11-1) bested his career high for strikeouts, notching 13.

The abbreviated list of pitchers to do it includes Whitey Ford, who did it in 1955. Dickey became the 11th pitcher since 1900 to accomplish the feat, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.The Orioles, an upstart club all season, had ranked third in the majors in home runs.

Dickey is amazing. - Camden Chat', "" I did not expect the Orioles to win this game. Did any of us? But I certainly didn't imagine that I'd witness a game like the one R.A. Dickey just pitched. The Orioles didn't have a chance against Dickey tonight, who is in the middle of an amazing season for the Mets. In five starts since May 22nd, Dickey has not allowed an earned run. He did allow an unearned run in his last start against the Tampa Bay Rays, a start in which he pitched a complete-game one hitter with no walks and 12 strikeouts. Surely he couldn't top that tonight, could he? Well, if he didn't top it, he at the very least tied it. Dickey had the Orioles batters flummoxed all night, allowing just one hit, a soft single. For over half this game, Dickey and Orioles starter Jake Arrieta exchanged zeroes on the scoreboard. Dickey retired the first eight batters he faced before walking Arrieta in the third. That didn't bother him thought, and he went right back to sitting down Orioles like it was nothing, inducing groundout after groundout. Dickey's no-hitter was finally broken up in the fifth inning by Wilson Betemit, who singled with two outs. He didn't stay on the bases long, though, as the next hitter, Steve Pearce flied out to end the inning.     As for Arrieta, after five fantastic innings, Jake got in trouble in the sixth thanks to a leadoff single from....you guessed it! R.A. Dickey. After a fly ball from Kirk Nieuwenhuis for the first out, Jordany Valdespin hit a fly ball to left fielder Steve Pearce. Pearce played the ball horribly and it went over his head for a double. It stinks that it happened that way, but I can't get on Pearce too much. He is, after all, an infielder. Finally the infielders playing the outfield came back to haunt this team. The double put runners on second and third with one out, and David Wright hit a liner to shortstop. J.J. Hardy made the catch and quickly tried to double up Dickey at third, but he just got his hand on the base in time. It's worth noting that if Betemit had put his foot on the bag as the throw was coming to him until waiting to catch it and then stepping on the base, the runner probably would have been out. But maybe Betemit's feet don't work that way. Arrieta pitched very carefully to the next batter, Lucas Duda, ultimately walking him. Given our hindsight, that probably wasn't the right move, but Duda has definitely been a better hitter this season than Ike Davis, the next batter up. I'm not sure what Arrieta was going for with his first pitch to Davis, but it ended up being a heater right down the heart of the plate. Davis put a good swing on it and it sailed out of the park in center field for the grand slam. Sigh.    Armed with a 4-0 lead (that would become a 5-0 lead thanks to Kevin Gregg getting some work in), Dickey had gone from tough to beat to impossible to beat. Gary Thorne and Mike Bordick talked in the booth that maybe the fact that Dickey was on the bases the entire inning might throw him off, but that wasn't even close to true. Of the final three innings he struck out six more batters, although he did issue a walk to Betemit in the eighth. As he threw strike three to Chris Davis to end the ballgame, I couldn't even be mad. Arrieta pitched better than his line showed in my opinion, and Dickey was a crazy knuckleball throwing strikeout machine.

In his two starts since the no-hitter, Santana had not shown that his left arm could handle the brunt of the performance of a lifetime and still rebound.But back home on Tuesday for the first time since no-hitting the St. Louis Cardinals, Santana put those doubts to rest. He pitched six shutout innings to lead the Mets in a 5-0 win over the Baltimore Orioles at Citi Field.No one was more relieved to see Santana finesse his way out of trouble in the fourth and sixth innings than Collins.

Dickey continued his masterful run by throwing his second straight one-hitter, and Ike Davis provided Dickey all the support he would need with his first career grand slam as the Mets beat the Baltimore Orioles 5-0 in front of 29,014 at Citi Field on Monday.  Dickey is the first pitcher to throw consecutive one-hitters since Dave Stieb in 1988.  Dickey, who issued two walks and struck out 13, threw his second shutout and third complete game in his last four starts. He hasn\'t allowed an earned run in his last 43 innings, a stretch in which he has allowed just 17 hits and four walks while striking out 54 batters.  Unlike last Wednesday, there was no controversy surrounding Dickey\'s one-hitter Monday. With the crowd already sensing history and chanting ""R.A. Dickey!"" Wilson Betemit laced a clean single to right field with two outs in the fifth. It was the first hit off Dickey in 13 innings, a span of 41 batters in which he issued just one walk and struck out 17.  The Mets appealed the decision on the lone hit off Dickey last week, an infield single by B.J. Upton that third baseman David Wright tried to barehand but didn\'t. Dickey retired 22 in a row after Upton\'s single before a Wright error and two passed balls by Dickey led to the Rays scoring an unearned run in the ninth.  On Monday, Dickey didn\'t allow a single baserunner past first base. He walked opposing pitcher Jake Arrieta in the third and Betemit in the eighth.  Arrieta matched zeroes with Dickey until the sixth when, appropriately enough, Dickey began the Mets\' rally with a leadoff single. He went to third on Jordany Valdespin\'s one-out double. Lucas Duda walked one out later and Davis crushed Arrieta\'s next pitch to dead center field for his first homer at Citi Field since May 6, 2011. Davis entered the at-bat hitting just .121 (12-for-99) at home this year.  Valdespin tripled with one out in the ninth and scored the Mets\' final run on Wright\'s infield single.  Arrieta allowed six hits and walked one while striking out four. He worked out of a jam in the second, when Duda singled and went to third on Scott Hairston\'s one-out single before Josh Thole grounded into an inning-ending 5-4-3 double play.  NOTES: Arrieta, who was sick Saturday night with what he thought was food poisoning, wasn\'t officially announced as the starter until he arrived at Citi Field. ""Just wanted to make sure his energy level [was good and that] he wasn\'t weak or anything,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ...

Showalter said outfielder Nolan Reimold (neck) visited with a second cervical specialist Monday and would not be back before the All-Star Break.

Dickey delivers the ball to the Baltimore Orioles during the second inning of an interleague baseball game, Monday, June 18, 2012, at Citi Field in New York. (AP Photo/Bill Kostroun)MoreNEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 R.A. Dickey\'s impeccable control with that dancing knuckleball has made him the most dominant pitcher in baseball.Dickey became the first major leaguer in 24 years to throw consecutive one-hitters and Ike Davis hit a grand slam to lead the New York Mets past the Baltimore Orioles 5-0 on Monday night.Coming off a one-hit gem at Tampa Bay last Wednesday, Dickey struck out a career-high 13 and allowed only Wilson Betemit\'s clean single in the fifth inning. He has not permitted an earned run in 42 2-3 innings, the second-longest stretch in club history behind Dwight Gooden\'s streak of 49 innings in 1985.""I\'m going to leave it to you guys to explain it. I\'m just going to try to be in the moment with it,"" Dickey said.The previous pitcher to throw consecutive one-hitters was Dave Stieb for Toronto in September 1988, according to STATS LLC. The Mets said the last to match the feat \xe2\x80\x94 or top it \xe2\x80\x94 in the National League was Jim Tobin with the 1944 Boston Braves, according to research by the Elias Sports Bureau. Tobin tossed a one-hitter followed by a no-hitter.The 37-year-old Dickey (11-1) walked two and became the first 11-game winner in the majors, befuddling Baltimore with knucklers that ranged from 66-81 mph in a game that took just 2 hours, 7 minutes. He fanned the final two hitters, topping his previous career best of 12 strikeouts set Wednesday against the Rays.""Yeah, it\'s surreal,"" Dickey said. ""You almost get emotional out there, especially that last hitter. You hear everybody, like one big heartbeat beating. That\'s the best way I could explain it.""A longtime journeyman before joining the Mets in 2010, Dickey has won nine straight decisions and six consecutive starts. He is tied for the major league lead in ERA (2.00), strikeouts (103) and complete games (three).It was his fourth game this season with double-digit strikeouts, most in the majors, and the fifth of his career. The right-hander has an incredible 71 strikeouts and six walks in his last seven starts.The Mets, who lead the NL with seven shutouts, had lost three straight and nine of 13.Betemit\'s two-out single in the fifth ended Dickey\'s franchise-record streak of 13 hitless innings.""Do I have a chance to appeal that base hit? Did anybody dive for that ball? I got a bad view,"" Mets manager Terry Collins said, drawing laughs.The only blemish Wednesday night was B.J. Upton\'s infield single with two outs in the first, a high bouncer that third baseman David Wright tried to field with his bare hand.After the game, the Mets appealed the official scoring decision to Major League Baseball, asking the commissioner\'s office to review the play and consider whether Wright should be charged with an error, thus giving Dickey the team\'s second no-hitter this month. The appeal was denied and Dickey said he was relieved, explaining that there would have been ""an asterisk by it bigger than the no-hitter itself.""""He has no wild pitches this year. That\'s impressive,"" Baltimore slugger Adam Jones said. ""He\'s in a groove.""One of the people Dickey can thank for his incredible success story is Orioles manager Buck Showalter, who was instrumental in persuading Dickey to remake himself into a knuckleballer when both were in Texas.""He had every attribute of a major league pitcher except the arm,"" Showalter said, his thoughts then turning to the fact that his team was about to face Dickey. ""I wish it hadn\'t happened.""After the game, Dickey said he would be remiss not to thank Showalter.""You know, and this is a tip of the hat to him: It was fairly poetic, I thought. The last game he saw me pitch live I gave up six home runs and tied a modern-day major league record,"" Dickey said. ""It\'s really incredible.""Betemit\'s line drive to right-center brought an ovation from the crowd of 29,014, which had started chanting ""R.A. Dickey!"" in the fifth.Dickey even sparked the New York rally with a leadoff single in the sixth against Jake Arrieta (3-9), a question mark to make his start until just a few hours before the game because he had been feeling ill the past few days.Jordany Valdespin doubled with one out and Dickey had to scramble back to third after he initially broke the wrong way on Wright\'s lineout to shortstop. The pitcher barely beat the throw, and that turned out to be a crucial play.Lucas Duda walked and Davis hit the next pitch just to the left of center for his seventh home run of the year and first career slam, prompting a curtain call.""My first time. It was really cool. I wasn\'t expecting it,"" said Davis, who has raised his batting average to .196 with a recent surge.The four RBIs set a career high for Davis. His drive would have stayed in the ballpark before the fences were brought in this season.Valdespin tripled off Kevin Gregg in the eighth and scored on Wright\'s single.Baltimore, which had won seven of eight, was coming off consecutive shutouts in Atlanta.NOTES: Dickey has a 1.21 ERA and 88 strikeouts during his nine-game winning streak. It was his fifth career shutout and second this season, both in June. ... Showalter said INF Robert Andino would be back in the lineup Tuesday night. ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Baseball gamesmanship - Birds Watcher', 'After the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 game was over last night I flipped my TV over to MASN2 to see the end of the game between the Washington Nationals and Tampa Rays. It looked like I flipped it over just in time, as there was controversy brewing in our nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital. We all know what happened by now; Washington manager Davey Johnson asked home plate umpire Tim Tschida to check incoming Tampa reliever Joel Peralta\xe2\x80\x99s glove for a foreign substance. Tschida definitely found something (later identified as pine tar); the glove was confiscated and taken into the umpire\xe2\x80\x99s room, and Peralta was ejected. Both managers had their say after the game, but it was obvious that Tampa skipper Joe Maddon was not happy with the series of events. He didn\xe2\x80\x99t argue that pine tar was on the glove, however he said that he felt it was \xe2\x80\x9cbush league\xe2\x80\x9d of the Nationals to call Peralta out on it.Well this is a hurky-jerky slippery slope, isn\xe2\x80\x99t it?! I see both sides here\xe2\x80\xa6to a point. Let\xe2\x80\x99s start with Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s perspective; as most people might be aware, I do believe in enforcing unwritten codes in baseball. Joel Peralta played for the Nationals in 2010, so all of this means that a Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 player ratted him out. Let me be frank here: I have no respect for a weasel. I suppose what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that this applies to the Jose Canseco rule in that there are certain things that go on in a locker room that should stay there. Davey Johnson himself all but confirmed this fact in his press conference; I believe his line was \xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\xa6well he [Peralta] used to play here.\xe2\x80\x9d HOWEVER, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Davey Johnson for asking the umpire to check. While he has a weasel in his clubhouse, he heard about something that was happening on the part of the other side. At that point he owed it to his team and to the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 fans to say something. In fairness, Tampa Manager Joe Maddon didn\xe2\x80\x99t try to deflect questions regarding the situation after the game. He freely admitted that there was pine tar in Peralta\xe2\x80\x99s glove, and when asked if that fact surprised him he responded by saying \xe2\x80\x9cI didn\xe2\x80\x99t say that.\xe2\x80\x9d Regardless of who ratted who out, what Peralta was doing was wrong and against the rules. Therefore I do wholeheartedly support Davey Johnson for calling the situation into question.There are a couple of other avenues by which to attack this situation. First off, the rat in the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse (whomever he is) knew about Peralta\xe2\x80\x99s tactics because Peralta played in Washington in 2010 (before Davey Johnson was the manager). Therefore by relaying this information he\xe2\x80\x99s also admitting that there has been cheating in the Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 midst in the past. Joe Maddon also said (after the game) something to the effect of if you\xe2\x80\x99re going to throw stones be sure that your own house is in order. Maddon also said that whomever the rat in the Washington clubhouse was showed poor sportsmanship. I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure I agree with that, given that Peralta was in fact cheating. It seems to me that cheating is poor sportsmanship no matter how you look at it.However I do understand what Maddon meant by that. (Furthermore, even if I disagree with the argument I do admire how he sticks up for his players.) He\xe2\x80\x99s referring back to the original act of someone ratting a guy out. It\xe2\x80\x99s one thing for a player to go to another team and for guys to give pointers here and there on that guy\xe2\x80\x99s tendencies on the field and so forth. However when it comes to something along these lines, there are probably guys in the clubhouse doing the same thing, if not worse things. It happens all over the place and all across the league. So yes, whomever ratted out Joel Peralta broke an unwritten code of ethics amongst players and coaches. And I do agree with Maddon in that teams around the league might not take kindly to the Nationals for exposing this. Again by admitting that he knew this, that guy is admitting that it\xe2\x80\x99s gone in within the Nationals in the past. Do the Nats really want other teams questioning their ethics on a daily basis?While I see both sides here, I think I do side a bit more with the Nationals. Ultimately the guy was cheating and there\xe2\x80\x99s very little defense to that. However again, I don\xe2\x80\x99t blame Johnson for questioning the validity of the glove but I do blame the weasel who blabbed it.\xc2\xa0I suppose what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that there\xe2\x80\x99s a right and a wrong way to go about doing things. Using pine tar in your glove is definitely the wrong way (and Peralta deserves whatever discipline he receives). However ratting someone out is also the wrong way to go about doing things. Whoever that guy is will now have to live with himself, and when/if his identity is ever discovered he might have to live with a bit more than himself in that in-game discipline might come his way.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Santana and Mets shut out Orioles 5-0 again', 'View photosNew York Mets\' Johan Santana delivers a pitch during the first inning of an interleague baseball game against the Baltimore Orioles Tuesday, June 19, 2012, in Queens.

A. Dickey has been pitching with such profound dominance lately that when he digs his fingernails into the ball at Citi Field on Sunday night and stares in at Derek Jeter, it will be hard not to think back to what a predecessor of Dickey\xe2\x80\x99s did 54 seasons ago.The last pitcher to no-hit the Yankees by himself was Hoyt Wilhelm, a godfather of the knuckleball, who twisted Yankee hitters into knots on Sept. 20, 1958, while pitching for the Baltimore Orioles. More than half a century later, Dickey, one of Wilhelm\xe2\x80\x99s knuckleball descendants, is pitching well enough to make you wonder: could he do what Wilhelm did, and on national TV no less?Dickey\xe2\x80\x99s last two starts were one-hitters, making him the first pitcher since Dave Stieb of the Toronto Blue Jays in 1988 to accomplish that feat. Dickey also struck out 12 and 13 batters in those games and became the first pitcher since 1900 to throw back-to-back complete games with one hit or fewer and at least 10 strikeouts in each game.Dickey, of course, is pitching better now than Wilhelm was in \xe2\x80\x9958. Wilhelm was a combined 3-10 that season for the Orioles and the Cleveland Indians, although his earned run average was a fine 2.34.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Dickey\xe2\x80\x99s current E.R.A is even better, standing at 2.00. His record, 11-1, is the best in baseball, and his matchup with C. C. Sabathia on Sunday night is the highlight of this Yankees-Mets weekend. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      And if it seems unlikely that a team with Jeter, Robinson Cano, Curtis Granderson, Alex Rodriguez and Dickey\xe2\x80\x99s friend Mark Teixeira could get no-hit, consider that Wilhelm did it against Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, Elston Howard, Bill Skowron and Bobby Richardson, all of whom would go on to beat Milwaukee in the World Series.

Credit             Associated Press           \xe2\x80\x9cWhatever Hoyt Wilhelm was able to achieve and pass on, that\xe2\x80\x99s definitely in me and in my pitches, in a sense,\xe2\x80\x9d Dickey said Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s part of the legacy, for sure. But it\xe2\x80\x99s not like I\xe2\x80\x99m going into a game thinking about that. I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to give my team a chance to win.\xe2\x80\x9dThe lineage of knuckleball pitchers is a tight one, and the line from Wilhelm to Dickey is easy to trace. Wilhelm tutored Charlie Hough, the Los Angeles Dodgers knuckleballer, and Hough tutored Dickey. In a way, Wilhelm\xe2\x80\x99s knuckleball is the grandfather of Dickey\xe2\x80\x99s.

Lasorda wanted Wilhelm to help Hough perfect his knuckleball, and he did.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Wilhelm gave Hough a new way to hold the ball, and he aligned him to the first-base side of the pitching rubber, which helped get Hough\xe2\x80\x99s knuckler over the plate.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Later, when Dickey was with the Texas Rangers, Hough was asked to tutor him, and he gave Dickey personalized instruction on the idiosyncratic art of the knuckleball, including tidbits culled from Wilhelm.\xe2\x80\x9cI was so fortunate to be able to learn from a Hall of Fame pitcher in Triple-A,\xe2\x80\x9d Hough said of Wilhelm in a telephone interview. \xe2\x80\x9cThe entire time I was with him, I made sure to play catch with him every day, because I felt I could learn from watching him closely. Anything I could pass on, some of it came from Hoyt, certainly.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Hough said Wilhelm \xe2\x80\x94 who was born in 1922 in Huntersville, N.C.; fought in the Battle of the Bulge in World War II; and pitched in the majors until he was nearly 50 \xe2\x80\x94 was modest. He never bragged about his no-hitter, even though it came against a team that was in the World Series almost every season.

Wilhelm came up with the Giants and was a relief pitcher until 1958, when the Orioles asked him to start for the first time, at age 35. His no-hitter came in only his ninth career start, on a rainy day at Memorial Stadium.

06/22/2012,"[('Nationals-Orioles Preview - yahoo.com', 'The Washington Nationals may be one of the biggest surprises in baseball, but Jason Hammel\'s rise with the Baltimore Orioles may be just as stunning.With their offense scuffling, the Orioles likely will need another strong effort from the right-hander Friday night when they face the Nationals in the opener of this three-game Beltway Series.Washington (40-27) is the surprise leader in the NL East, as it tries to eventually reach the playoffs for just the second time in franchise history and first since 1981 as the Montreal Expos.While the Nationals\' success has been unexpected, the same could be said for Hammel (7-2, 2.87 ERA) after he was acquired by Baltimore (39-30) in a three-player trade with Colorado in the offseason.He\'s among the AL leaders in ERA and has already matched his win total from last season.Hammel had the best performance of his career in Saturday\'s 5-0 win at Atlanta. He carried a no-hitter into the seventh inning and finished with a one-hitter and eight strikeouts in his second career complete game and first shutout in seven major league seasons.""It used to be, for me, too many things were going on,"" Hammel told the team\'s official website. ""I was worried about the what ifs and what might happen instead of going hitter to hitter and that\'s what I was able to do. It\'s not rocket science.""Hammel is 4-0 with a 3.99 ERA in six starts against the Nationals, allowing four runs over 5 1-3 innings of a 6-5 victory May 19.He may need to be better than that since the Orioles are hitting .159 with one homer and 12 runs during a 2-4 stretch. They\'re 0 for 17 with runners in scoring position in four games since Hammel\'s last start.Baltimore batted .130 while being swept in a three-game series by the New York Mets, losing the finale 4-3 Wednesday after getting blanked in the first two contests.""I know our guys are frustrated,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We\'ve beaten some very good pitchers and to get where we want to go, we\'re going to (have to find a way to keep doing that).""The Orioles will be in for another test against the Nationals and their major league-leading 3.00 ERA.Jordan Zimmermann (3-5, 2.92) has been a big part of Washington\'s strong staff but he\'s 0-1 in his past four starts. The right-hander has a 1.62 ERA in five road interleague outings, but just an 0-2 record to show for it since he\'s been backed by an average of 2.16 runs. That includes a loss in his only visit to Baltimore on May 22, 2011, when he yielded two runs and four hits in 6 1-3 innings of a 2-1 defeat.Zimmermann allowed three runs - two earned - and five hits with six strikeouts in six innings, while his teammates committed two errors and provided two runs of support in a 5-3, 14-inning loss to the New York Yankees on Saturday.The Nationals are trying to build on Thursday\'s 5-2 win over Tampa Bay, taking two of three from the Rays to improve to 9-6 in interleague play this season.Bryce Harper was 4 for 12 with two RBIs against the Orioles in May, but is 5 for 28 in the past seven games overall. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 2, Nationals 1: Thunder and lightning - Camden Chat', "" It was a dark and stormy night when Jason Hammel took the mound. The game was delayed for an hour due to a thunderstorm that never quite arrived, but Hammel was both thunder and lightning tonight. In tying his career high of ten strikeouts, he flashed a mid-90s fastball with great command - no walks at all - and brought his own lightning with a curveball that made hitters look foolish. Natitude brought itself to Birdland tonight, and the orange wave rolls out triumphant into the Baltimore night. One start after his complete game shutout performance in Atlanta, it looked like Hammel might be trying to do that very same thing again, just with more hits allowed. He gave up five on the night and powered through two errors by Mark Reynolds at first base. The lone run was unearned. There were a couple of hard hit balls in the 8th and he did not return for the 9th. Jim Johnson came in to close it out and fielded a sharp liner by Danny Espinosa after getting two quick outs to end the game. Hammel needed to be at his best again, because the Orioles offense was not in a mood to deliver, although they delivered just enough. Reynolds delivered a bit of redemption for his defensive play by hitting a solo home run in the 2nd inning, getting out ahead of the unearned run that scored because of his throwing error on a weird play where a runner managed to score from first on an infield grounder. The less said about it, the better. Hammel also had to contend with another game with Chris Davis in the outfield. While he had that one nice diving catch in Atlanta, he seemed to try to duplicate that play today on a ball that he had no business diving towards. No big deal: Jason will just go ahead and strike out the side. Who needs outfielders anyway? The Orioles' other run - the margin of victory - came in the 5th inning where they managed to scratch out a run with a couple of two out base hits. Nick Johnson was hit by a pitch, took second on a single by Brian Roberts and scored on a double by J.J. Hardy. There were two outs and two men on as Davis came to the plate, but he flew out to center to end the threat. Davis is now 0 for his last 24, but Hammel needed no more help. He must have been watching during the series against New York and decided to take matters into his own hands.    It's tough to express how much of a surprise Hammel has been. We often talk on here about how the official Camden Chat opinion seemed to be that Jeremy Guthrie was traded for a couple of guys who would probably not be any better than him. Instead we have our hands on a strikeout pitcher who's sporting a 2.61 ERA after 14 starts, good for 6th lowest in the ERA. He is a dominant pitcher and he is the reason the Orioles won tonight.    The hot-hitting Bryce Harper had no chance against Hammel. He went 0-4. The Nationals contingent in the crowd tried to get a little cheer going for him as he came up to the plate in the first inning, but they were lustily booed down by the rest of a sellout crowd of 45,891 that stuck it out through the rain that fell intermittently throughout the game. There were a number of them there, but being as they are newly-converted Nats fans, they don't really know how to get cheers going, like, say, the Philadelphia fans did. There was no doubt that this was Oriole Park tonight. There were only four at-bats for the Nationals all night where there were runners in scoring position. Two came in the second after Davis played the Michael Morse liner into a double - it would have likely just been a single if he hadn't made the dive - and two followed back-to-back hits by Ian Desmond and Espinosa in the 7th. Hammel responded by whiffing Roger Bernadina to bring up catcher Jesus Flores with two down. After eight innings with no earned runs tonight, he's working on a 19 inning scoreless streak.    Flores hit a hard liner to short. I was ready to groan in agony, but then J.J. Hardy leaped and made the catch as the crowd went wild. The hardest thing about being in the press box is that you're not supposed to cheer. I have about one moment a game where I can't resist making a small gesture or letting one sound escape. This was my moment in this game. I half-raised my fists and immediately thought better of it. I hope they'll forgive me my one slight. With the win, the Orioles picked up their 40th of the year, bringing them to a 40-30 record. They haven't had 40 wins in June since 2008, when they were 40-36, where last year they had a record of 40-57 on July 23 and a record of 40-74 on August 11 in 2010. That will play. Johnson's save was his 21st of the year. Could he and Hammel both be playing their way into the All-Star conversation? Johnson now sports a 1.14 ERA. The O's now have a 12-6 record in one run games, and not surprisingly they are 18-1 when their starter goes at least seven innings in the game. This continues to be the story for the Orioles: as long as the starting pitching is good enough, then the bullpen closes the door and they win some exciting games. Tonight was no exception as they got back on the right foot after being swept in New York. They will look to get back to their series winning ways tomorrow evening at 7:15pm - which I believe will be another FOX game, so those of you in unfortunate markets may be screwed. The matchup will be Wei-Yin Chen for the Orioles against Edwin Jackson for the Nats.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

A. Dickey was throwing his knuckleball just under 80 m.p.h. His counterpart with the Baltimore Orioles that night, Jake Arrieta, throws 92-m.p.h. fastballs. The speed differential between their pitches more than doubled Maddux\xe2\x80\x99s.While no batter had to deal with that contrast, the home-plate umpire, Eric Cooper, did. He faced the challenge of adjusting his vision to the different pitches and establishing a consistent strike zone between two extremely different pitchers.From Eddie Cicotte in the early 1900s to Dickey, no two knuckleballers have been exactly the same, but each presents similar challenges to umpires. As Dickey has shown while going 11-1 with a 2.00 earned run average and consecutive one-hitters, speed differential is just one thing that makes umpires earn their money.

Credit             Stacie Freudenberg/Associated Press for The New York Times           It is common for broadcasters to suggest an umpire is expanding the strike zone with a pitcher like Dickey on the mound in hopes of encouraging batters to swing rather than sit through long pitch counts associated with the fluttering pitch. It is an assertion two retired umpires rejected.

In contrast, Hough averaged 3.9 walks, Wakefield averaged 3.4, and Phil Niekro, a Hall of Famer, averaged 3.0 over their careers.Despite his control and a knuckleball thrown much harder than the usual one, Dickey is still a far cry from the average major league pitcher.

So, sure, he will not rule out a future in which more pitchers embrace his chosen weapon, the knuckleball, and give it equal billing alongside baseball\xe2\x80\x99s 100-mile-per-hour fastballs and 12-to-6 curves.He is open to the idea that his startling success for the Mets this season \xe2\x80\x94 a run that has grabbed much attention in New York and, increasingly, around the country \xe2\x80\x94 might inspire a new generation of knuckleballers and rescue the pitch from the game\xe2\x80\x99s fringes, where it now resides as an oddity, a quirky skill of last resort.Yet Dickey, 37, has also been around, a journeyman for far more years than he has been a star, and he knows quite well that what you would like to see happen often does not. Ultimately, he does not think much is going to change at all.\xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d Dickey said of a theoretical knuckleball revolution. \xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it likely?

Last year, his knuckleball was just as good, but lack of run support left him with an 8-13 record.

Known for being inquisitive and literate; admired for climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro this past off-season and raising money for charity as part of the adventure; admired, too, for a recently released, and painfully honest, memoir, Dickey now is all that as well as the pitcher who is tied for the lowest earned run average (2.00) in baseball and who has the third-highest strikeout total (103).Doesn\xe2\x80\x99t anyone want to join him?One person who thought about the knuckleball, probably even before Dickey did, was Mark Lemke, who won a World Series ring as a second baseman for the Atlanta Braves in 1995 and then tried to reinvent himself as a knuckleballer in his mid-30s.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) It would have taken quite a performance for Jason Hammel to improve upon his previous start, so the Baltimore Orioles right-hander happily settled for going deep into the game and earning another victory.Hammel pitched eight innings of five-hit ball and had a career high-tying 10 strikeouts to lead the Orioles past the Washington Nationals 2-1 on Friday night.Coming off a one-hit shutout against Atlanta, Hammel (8-2) allowed an unearned run in improving to 5-0 lifetime against Washington. He didn't top his outing against the Braves, but at least he built on it.''It can't really get much better than that for me,'' Hammel said of his gem in Atlanta. ''Obviously a no-hitter or a perfect game, but that didn't happen. I did basically the same thing, just come at them with two-seamers, aggressive in the zone, make them swing and put it in play.''Hammel, who did not issue a walk, has gone 19 straight innings without giving up an earned run.''His outings the last two times out, and really most of the year, have been fun to watch,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''When you have command of that many pitches in your repertoire and you put him and (catcher Matt) Wieters on the same team, you like your chances. And he probably should have had eight shutout innings. He was outstanding.''Showalter removed Hammel after 96 pitches, ruining his chance to become the first Oriole to throw two straight complete games since Sidney Ponson in May 2004.''I was surprised I didn't go back out in the ninth,'' Hammel said.Jim Johnson got three outs for his 21st save.''Hammel's leaking a little oil there toward the end,'' Showalter said. ''You feel a lot more confident about turning a game over to someone like (Johnson).''Mark Reynolds homered, and J.J. Hardy contributed offensively and defensively in helping Baltimore end a three-game losing streak.Hammel outpitched Washington's Ryan Zimmermann (3-6), who allowed two runs and eight hits over seven innings. Zimmerman is 0-2 in his last five starts since May 22.''He's pitched great, we just haven't been scoring for him,'' Nationals manager Davey Johnson said. ''We hit the ball hard today with runners on, got zilch.''Baltimore took a 2-1 lead in the fifth on a two-out RBI double by Hardy, who stepped to the plate mired in a 1-for-25 slump.In the Washington seventh, with two on and two outs, Hardy leaped high to snare Jesus Flores' liner to shortstop.''I jumped as high as I could and it just went into my mitt,'' said Hardy, who made a similar catch on Steve Lombardozzi's hard-hit ball in the eighth.Davey Johnson last watched a game in the dugout at Camden Yards in 1997, when he guided the Orioles to the AL East title. He was fired after the season by owner Peter Angelos, and Baltimore hasn't had a winning season since.''Managers are hired to get fired. All the times I was here were fun times for me,'' Johnson said before the game. ''I really enjoyed playing here and learning the game of baseball here. It was fun to come back and manage in the town where I had played in. Played in a bunch of World Series here. My only regret was that I didn't get to manage the team in a World Series here. All my memories of Baltimore and baseball are nothing but great memories.''After the start was delayed 61 minutes by the threat of rain, Hammel pitched a perfect first inning and struck out the side in the second around a double by Michael Morse.In the bottom of the second, Reynolds lined a 1-1 fastball into the seats in left to end an 0-for-11 skid.It was one of precious few mistakes by Zimmermann, but it proved costly.'I just try to keep the team in it as long as I can and stay out there as long as I can and save the bullpen,'' he said. ''I didn't have my best stuff tonight, but it was good enough to get through seven.''Washington tied it in the fifth. Ian Desmond singled, rounded second base and took off for third on a groundout and scored on Reynolds' errant throw from first to third.NOTES: The game drew a crowd of 45,891, the fourth sellout of the season at Camden Yards. ...

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) The reason why the Washington Nationals are in first place in the NL East can be summed up in one word: pitching.Edwin Jackson hammered home that point against the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night, taking a one-hitter into the seventh inning to provide Washington with a 3-1 victory.Adam LaRoche homered for the Nationals, who made the most of eight hits in improving to 10-7 in interleague play and 2-3 against Baltimore.Jackson (4-4) gave up one run, four hits and a walk in 6 1-3 innings. He retired the first 12 batters he faced and permitted only one runner past first base through six innings.Jackson appeared dominant, but it was actually a struggle.''It was kind of a funny game because Edwin didn't feel too good when he started the game,'' Nationals manager Davey Johnson said.Said Jackson: ''I wasn't sick. It was just one of those days you don't have blow-away stuff. You just have to go out and pitch. That's pretty much what it was from the time I started throwing in the pen, I knew what kind of day it was going to be.''Four pitchers in Washington's starting rotation - Jackson, Stephen Strasburg, Gio Gonzalez and Jordan Zimmermann - have an ERA under 3.00.''It's unbelievable,'' Johnson said. ''It just shows you how good they've been going. I'm impressed, and I'm not easily impressed.''Washington hasn't scored in double figures this season and owns a team batting average of .238, but these guys sure can throw the baseball - as evidenced by their major-league leading 2.96 ERA.''That's a good team, and it starts with their starting pitching,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''And their bullpen's doing well, too.''Such was the case Saturday night.After Adam Jones ruined Jackson's shutout bid by leading off the seventh with a home run, the right-hander retired Matt Wieters on a deep fly before giving up successive singles.Former Oriole Michael Gonzalez came in and got pinch-hitter Ronny Paulino to line into an inning-ending double play.Sean Burnett worked the eighth, and Tyler Clippard got three straight outs for his 12th save in 13 tries.Baltimore has lost four of five, scoring only six runs in that span. The Orioles were blanked twice by the Mets and needed Jones' team-high 19th homer to avoid a shutout in this one.''You're not going to throw up a lot of runs every night, but New York had some great pitching against us, and these guys, that's why they're in first place,'' Baltimore's Mark Reynolds said. ''They've got good arms. It's tough to get a rally going against a guy like Edwin.''Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen (7-3) allowed three runs, two earned, and six hits in five innings. He bloodied his fingernail on a comebacker in the fourth inning, but did not blame that on his shaky performance.''Physically, mentally and mechanically, I felt really great, but I got in some trouble after two strikes,'' Chen said through an interpreter. ''I cannot finish out.''The Taiwan native won his three previous starts, over Boston, Pittsburgh and Atlanta. He is 0-2 with a 7.71 ERA in his two outings against Washington and 7-1 in his other 12 starts.The game attracted 46,298 fans, the fifth sellout at Camden Yards this season. The first was on opening day, and the Phillies and Nationals each drew two packed houses.Washington went up 2-0 in the second inning. With runners at second and third and two outs, Orioles third baseman Wilson Betemit ranged to his left to grab a grounder by Xavier Nady, then bounced a throw to first that eluded Reynolds. Nady received credit for an RBI single, and the other run came home on the throwing error.LaRoche led off the fourth with his team-leading 13th homer, a towering fly that dropped over the center-field wall. Eleven of his last 16 hits have been for extra bases.Baltimore's first runner came when Jones reached on an error by third baseman Ryan Zimmerman leading off the fifth. He took third on a one-out single by Wilson Betemit, and after a walk loaded the bases with two outs, Jackson retired Steve Pearce on a popup.NOTES: Jackson is 6-1 lifetime against Baltimore, 4-0 with a 1.02 ERA over the last four seasons. ...

Baltimore won 2-1. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) A tense interleague series between two neighboring teams with exceptional pitching staffs was decided by a timely swing from a player who almost got the day off.Matt Wieters hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning to interrupt Baltimore's agonizing offensive struggle, and the Orioles squeezed past the Washington Nationals 2-1 Sunday.Baltimore appeared headed for its third shutout loss in six games before Adam Jones led off the eighth with a single off Sean Burnett (0-1) and Wieters drove an 0-1 pitch over the center-field wall.''It felt great,'' Wieters said. ''Everyone was battling up there, trying to grind through at-bats to get a run, and to finally get one was great.''After Wieters gave Baltimore the lead, he sealed the victory in the ninth. With one out, Jim Johnson struck out Danny Espinosa and Wieters threw out Ian Desmond attempting to steal second base.''Any out you can get, especially the 27th out, is huge,'' Wieters said.Orioles manager Buck Showalter considered resting his workhorse catcher, who also played Saturday night, then decided against it.''I came close to not playing Matt, with an off-day (Monday),'' Showalter said.Prior to the home run, the Orioles wasted several scoring opportunities and stranded eight runners over seven innings. Baltimore scored only five runs in the series and went 1 for 16 with runners in scoring position, yet still managed to win two of three.''You win games with pitching,'' Wieters said. ''And then it takes one big swing, or a couple of guys to get on and find some holes, and then you're right back in the lead.''The way the Orioles were hitting, it seemed unlikely they would mount a sustained attack against the Nationals. Fortunately, Wieters gave Baltimore everything it needed for another interleague victory.''Clutch,'' teammate J.J, Hardy said. ''I mean, to win a ballgame like that the way we've been swinging was something we needed. It just didn't seem like we were going to piece together a bunch of hits.''The Orioles finished 11-7 in interleague play and won five of six series.Pedro Strop (4-2) got the final out in the eighth for Baltimore and Johnson worked the ninth for his 22nd save.Ryan Zimmerman had the lone RBI for the Nationals, who scored five runs in the series. Washington was 34-2 when leading after seven innings.The Nationals looked every bit like the team with the best ERA in the majors - except for that one pitch to Wieters.''He just got a fastball over the heart of the plate,'' Washington manager Davey Johnson said.''I tried to go with my strength and left the ball out over the plate,'' Burnett said. ''He's a good hitter and made me pay for it.''Wieters' hit turned the series in Baltimore's favor. The Orioles won the opener 2-1, then lost 3-1 before taking the finale.''We play a lot of close games, and our bullpen expects to get the job done in those situations,'' Burnett said. ''Today I let one slip away.''Making his first start for the Nationals since May 25, Ross Detwiler allowed four hits and walked two in five innings. In his previous start against Baltimore on May 19, the left-hander gave up six runs. But that was at a point in the season when the Orioles scored 32 runs over a six-game span.Jake Arrieta gave up one run and five hits in six innings, and it still took an unlikely comeback by the Orioles for him to avoid becoming the first 10-game loser in the big leagues this season.Zimmerman snapped a 5-for-49 slump and gave Washington a 1-0 third-inning lead with a two-out single that scored Jhonatan Solano. Zimmerman, who had a cortisone shot in his ailing right shoulder before the game, went 2 for 4.Detwiler retired his first seven batters and was cruising until the fourth, when Baltimore loaded the bases with two outs. Ronny Paulino hit a harmless fly ball to end the threat.In the Orioles fifth, two singles and a groundout put runners on second and third with two outs for Jones, who hit a fly ball to deep left.Bryce Harper led off the Washington sixth by turning a bouncer up the middle into a dash-for-second double, but Arrieta worked out of trouble by getting Desmond to hit a two-out popup.Baltimore's frustration continued in the seventh, when Hardy grounded out with runners on second and third and two outs.NOTES: On Monday night in Colorado, Washington RHP Stephen Strasburg vies to become the first player in Nationals history to win seven consecutive starts. ... The Orioles open a two-game series against the Los Angeles Angels on Tuesday. LHP Dana Eveland likely will begin paternity leave on that day, and it's possible that RHP Matt Lindstrom (finger) will be activated from the disabled list to fill out the Baltimore roster. ... Nationals closer Drew Storen, who had elbow surgery in April, hopes to make his season debut next weekend in Atlanta. ... Held out of the starting lineup in part because of an 0-for-28 slump, Baltimore's Chris Davis flied out as a pinch hitter. ...

The most recent, a 7-1 defeat on Monday at Yankee Stadium, was over early. The Yankees scored two runs in each of the first three innings, and the Indians do not win slugfests.But they do win games. Somehow, the Indians remain two games over .500, at 37-35, in second place in the American League Central. A formula based on run differential, devised by Bill James, says the Indians should be at least nine games below .500. And yet, here they are.\xe2\x80\x9cOver all, we\xe2\x80\x99re pleased that we\xe2\x80\x99re still in the race despite clearly not playing our best baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d General Manager Chris Antonetti said outside the visiting clubhouse after the game.\xe2\x80\x9cWe still feel like the roster we have has a lot of upside to it and hasn\xe2\x80\x99t played to our potential.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Indians are not imposing. Their best-known players, Grady Sizemore and Travis Hafner, are on the disabled list. Right fielder Shin-Soo Choo and catcher Carlos Santana have not become consistent stars.

They play series against the Yankees, the Baltimore Orioles, the Los Angeles Angels and the Tampa Bay Rays before the All-Star break. Losing two of three in Houston last weekend was not an encouraging send-off.Back home, the fans seem skeptical. The Indians have turned over nearly their entire roster since 2007, when they beat the Yankees in the division series. The progress they seemed to show last season, when they started 30-15, was overshadowed by finishing 15 games behind the division-winning Detroit Tigers. Now Cleveland ranks last in the league in attendance, averaging only 18,408 fans a game.Perez has expressed frustration with that, and did so again Monday. He said fans seemed to care more about rooting against LeBron James and the Miami Heat than they do about rooting for the Indians.

With the Battle of the Beltways in full swing this weekend, I had the opportunity to really interact with fans in both red and blue and orange and black.Mandatory Credit: Joy R. Absalon-US PRESSWIREObviously, the fans from Baltimore make me smile a little bigger. The series versus the Nats this weekend brought in the biggest crowd of the season, 133,983, including two sellouts. Each night, as I looked out the window from an upper level, I was so thrilled to see the seats filled, and filled with orange for that matter.I\xe2\x80\x99ve said it many times before, and I\xe2\x80\x99ll say it again, there is nothing better than walking down Eutaw Street or looking at a crowd packed with Orioles fans.Granted, the team is doing very well, and to say that they are exceeding preseason expectations would be an embarrassing understatement. And with wins come fans. However, Baltimore baseball fandom should not hinge on the team\xe2\x80\x99s record.If I didn\xe2\x80\x99t work at the Yard, I can tell you for certain that I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t want to miss Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x99 go-ahead home run, the smell of Boog\xe2\x80\x99s on Eutaw Street, the strong start by Jake Arrieta, the nail-biters or Hammel pitching well enough to draw strong All-Star consideration. And that was just this weekend.So, even with the offense struggling, I encourage you to come out the Yard. Even if the Orioles were to start slipping, for O\xe2\x80\x99s fans, there is no better place than Camden.Keep heading out to the Yard, or start heading out to the Yard, so I can keep that big grin as I look down at the stands.Here\xe2\x80\x99s a picture that I took of Eutaw Street this weekend.

06/26/2012,"[('Baltimore Orioles: The Camden Faithful - \\u2026', 'This past weekend in a three-game series with Washington, the Orioles drew 133,983 fans in total (Fri-Sun). This comes on the heels of a 130K plus attendance weekend two weeks prior against Philadelphia. The difference of course is that the attendance statistic was helped by Philadelphia fans. There was a smattering of Washington Nationals fans in attendance at all three games this past weekend. However I\xe2\x80\x99d put their numbers at 4-5 thousand per game give or take. All three games were pro-Oriole crowds. Not only that, however the fans were into the games. Granted the Birds had trouble scoring in each circumstance (albeit winning two-of-three games), however you could feel that the fans were begging to just blow the lid off of the place.We\xe2\x80\x99ve seen crowds like this in the past in non-Opening Day situations at the yard. I remember\xc2\xa0attending the second-to-last game of the season in 2004 against Boston, and there being a huge amount of buzz\xe2\x80\xa6as a result of the fact that the city of Boston had to have been empty that weekend. They had all transplanted themselves in the Baltimore area. I also remember a few years ago attending a late season weekend game against New York that had the same phenomenon. We all know those kinds of stories by now, however I often feel that rekindling the bitterness of those moments helps to make what\xe2\x80\x99s currently happening with the Birds all the more sweet!That aside, there was a definite buzz around downtown all weekend, and it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the result of the opponent. The Hardy, Jones, Markakis, Arrieta, etc. shirts were all around the city. (Sure there was the occasional Harper or Strasburg jersey but that\xe2\x80\x99s to be expected.) Pickles and Sliders (two bars across from Camden Yards for those who don\xe2\x80\x99t know) couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have been more packed if U2 had been playing. If you think about it, this is really\xc2\xa0a great little story that Baltimore is writing for itself with this concept of winning baseball. I think that there\xe2\x80\x99s still a school of thought out there that it could come crashing to a halt at anytime, but much less so than there was a month ago. Sure things could come crashing down at any time, and quick at that; but\xe2\x80\xa6what if they don\xe2\x80\x99t?The point of this column is to act as a kudos for the Orioles, but as well as for the fans. For so long there have been two schools of thought: 1) Put a winner on the field and people will come back, and 2) It will take more than just one season to make fans believe again. I think that both of these points are true in 2012. As I said above, there\xe2\x80\x99s always that lingering doubt which says that things could turn south at any moment. So yes, perhaps there are some people that are having a tough time totally buying into this. However the fact is that they\xe2\x80\x99re still coming out to the yard. Right here and right now, the Orioles ARE\xc2\xa0a winning team\xe2\x80\xa6and people are coming.I think that a lot of folks underestimated the clout that the Orioles still have in Baltimore. The going idea was that due to 14 losing seasons the Ravens had eclipsed the O\xe2\x80\x99s as \xe2\x80\x9cBaltimore\xe2\x80\x99s darling team.\xe2\x80\x9d For all I know that might be true. However again, I think that the amount of love for this Oriole team has been underestimated. The Baltimore fans were just dying to re-embrace this franchise, and now they\xe2\x80\x99re seizing the opportunity. The fans are coming back, and many are entering Camden Yards for the first time in years. While I do believe there\xe2\x80\x99s something to be said for loyalty through thick and thin, to those folks I would offer a big WELCOME HOME!One thing that Oriole fans will have to train themselves to do is to buy tickets in advance. I think that the days of being able to saunter up to the box office 30 minutes before first pitch (on weekends at least) and getting a ticket are over. This in itself is a good thing! Along with that, the days of ushers asking people to \xe2\x80\x9ctone it down\xe2\x80\x9d in the stands may well end as well. (Yes folks, that\xe2\x80\x99s happened; I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen it.) Anyone that attended any of the Washington games knows what I\xe2\x80\x99m talking about when I mention the buzz in the stands. People were living and dying on every pitch. The anguish and joy on the faces of the fans at various points all indicates that Baltimore is once again falling in love with it\xe2\x80\x99s baseball team. Whether or not this team goes to the playoffs in 2012 remains to be seen, however one fact is sure: they\xe2\x80\x99re in contention. That\xe2\x80\x99s all that most fans have been asking over the past 14 years.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Then, in the fifth inning, the slugger ripped a 1-0 pitch into the inviting left-field seats to stake the Angels to a 3-0 lead.Pujols has now homered in 33 ballparks off 282 different pitchers.''It's just a testament to what a career he's had,'' teammate Mark Trumbo said. ''He sure didn't wait very long. Best hitter in this era.''If Pujols was impressed with the feat, he apparently had no desire to talk about it. Long after the game ended, he still hadn't arrived at his locker.Los Angeles finished with a season-high four homers. Peter Bourjos, Trumbo and John Hester also connected for the Angels, who have won 12 of 16 overall and 12 of their last 13 road games.''This park is always been a park where the ball flies,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''In this park you just have to put it in your mind there are going to be home runs. It's a nice offensive park.''It hasn't been that way lately for the Orioles, who were held in check by Wilson (9-4). The left-hander gave up six hits, struck out two and walked two to improve to 5-0 in seven starts since May 18. Wilson has a 1.30 ERA over that span.''My sinker was great the first couple of innings and then just checked out of the hotel. It was going to Toronto I guess,'' he joked. ''We had to adjust on the fly.''Steve Pearce and Wilson Betemit homered for the Orioles, who have lost five of seven. Baltimore has scored a total of 11 runs over those seven games. The Orioles went 1 for 8 with runners in scoring position and are 2 for 41 in that situation over their last eight games.''You have to take the positive out of it. We keep getting ourselves into position, we just need to hit,'' center fielder Adam Jones said. ''We've left some guys on base, we had the opportunity to score more runs, and we didn't. But we had the opportunity. We have to bear down, get in scoring position and get that hit. It's not easy.''Matusz (5-9) allowed five runs and a career-high 13 hits in five-plus innings. He has lost four straight starts, and on each occasion failed to get out of the sixth inning.''It's been just a couple pitches here and there each game,'' the left-hander said. ''It's just being able to eliminate the mistakes and get back on track.''Pujols hit his team-high 18th double with two outs in the first inning but was stranded. In the second, Los Angeles had runners at second and third with two outs before Hester hit a fly ball to the warning track in left.The Angels broke through in the third, going up 1-0 when Mike Trout led off with a double and scored on a single by Torii Hunter.In the Los Angeles fourth, Erick Aybar inexplicably tried to score from first on a two-out single to center by Hester and didn't get near the plate before being tagged out by Matt Wieters.After going hitless over the first three innings, Baltimore used two singles and a stolen base to put runners at the corners with one out in the fourth. The next two batters, however, failed to hit the ball out of the infield.Pujols homered in the fifth after Hunter singled. Pearce connected in the bottom half, the first homer off Wilson in eight starts since May 12, but Baltimore couldn't add on after getting runners to second and third with one out.Bourjos chased Matusz in the sixth with a two-run drive, and Trumbo hit a shot in the seventh off Tommy Hunter that traveled an estimated 448 feet.Hester homered off Kevin Gregg in the eighth, and Betemit connected with a man on against Jason Isringhausen in the bottom half.NOTES: Pujols has 11 homers and 34 RBIs in 38 games since May 15. ... Hester finished with a career-best three hits. Howie Kendrick also had three hits. ... Jones stole third base in the fourth inning, Baltimore's first steal in 18 games since June 5. ... In the series finale Wednesday, the Angels will send Jered Weaver (7-1) to the mound and the Orioles will start Jason Hammel, who's 4-0 at home and 8-2 overall. ... Los Angeles is 35-19 since a 6-14 start. ... Aybar extended his hitting streak to 11 games. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Thinking About the Orioles and Where Things Stand', "" There's good news and there's bad news. The good news is that this morning the Orioles are nine games over .500 and it is the final week of June. That hasn't been the case since this exact date in 2005. The bad news, aside from yet another comparison to that horrible doomed year of 2005, is that this morning the Orioles also have not scored more runs than they've allowed. That fact doesn't match up with this date in 2005. The latest point in that season the Orioles did not give up more runs than they've scored was July 28. That was also the last day the 2005 birds were over .500. The O's haven't played like a team on a 91 win pace, and they haven't even played as well as any of the other AL East teams, all of whom are outscoring their opponents. Looking at the currency of the game being runs, there's not a lot of good news in Baltimore. But, on the other hand, the O's are nine games over .500. You can't take those wins away just because the losses have been worse looking than the wins. Those wins are in the bank. The reason for the Orioles outperforming their run differential (that is, the difference between their runs scored and runs allowed) isn't that they've been especially adept at winning one run ballgames, or especially prone to losing big. They've outscored their opponents by seven in one run games (13-6), and they've outscored their opponents by one in five-plus run games (10-9). It is the other 35 games (18-17), where opponents have outscored them by eight runs to no avail. In a typical game you can expect the Orioles to score less runs than their opponent, but still win. That doesn't sound sustainable.   Still, even if we discount the Orioles chances at continuing this run to a 91 win season and say instead they've played like a 81 win team - against a schedule which baseball-reference ranks as the most difficult in baseball so far - that should still make you smile. This is still a team to be proud of, surprisingly enough. With the wins already in the bank, even a return to earth (let's say a 75 win pace, or 41-48) by the O's would net them an 82 win season.    A winning season. That, to put it mildly, is not nothing.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Angels 13, Orioles 1: A game worth ignoring - Camden Chat', ' I knew tonight that I\'d miss the start of the baseball game because instead I\'d be attending my niece\'s 8th birthday party. But the birthday parties of eight year olds don\'t last too long and I figured Jason Hammel would keep it on lock down until I had a chance to turn the game on in the car on the way home. That didn\'t exactly happen. We tuned in to hear Tom Davis calling play-by-play just as Chris Davis struck out in the bottom of the third inning with the Angels leading 3-1. ""Really, Jason Hammel? Three runs already?"" I said to the radio. Turns out that after Hammel had given up a home run to Torii Hunter in the top of the first inning, the O\'s came back to tie it in the bottom of the inning when Adam Jones doubled in Chris Davis. But the Angels had added two more in the top of the third thanks to a 2-RBI single from Kendrys Morales. So there we were in the car, listening to the top of the fourth inning. Alberto Callaspo doubled, then came around to score on a single from Howard Kendrick. Can someone please tell me when he stopped being called Howie Kendrick? I prefer Howie, and you\'ll note that the SBN auto tagger agrees with me. At any rate, Hammel got an out but then gave up a single to put runners on the corners. That\'s when fill-in announcer Tom Davis, who is keeping Fred Manfra\'s seat warm while Fred suns himself on the beach or something, said, ""And here comes Buck Showalter to the mound, that\'ll be it for Hammel. Well, maybe they aren\'t taking him out. Actually that\'s Rick Adair."" Whatever Adair said had little effect as the next batter, Mike Trout, hit an RBI single to the pitcher. I don\'t really know how that even happens and Tom Davis wasn\'t interested in explaining it to me, but it sounded ridiculous. So I said to my traveling companion, ""Mind if we turn this off?"" We switched to 90s on 9 and jammed out to some Paula Abdul for the rest of the drive home.    I wanted to give the Orioles a chance to get their acts together, so when we got home we decided to watch a new summer series called The Great Escape, which pits three teams against each other in a race to get through some obstacles and such and ""escape"" their surroundings, which tonight was Alcatraz. The show wasn\'t that great, but when it ended and I turned the baseball game back on, I realized I\'d definitely been watching the better of two options.    The score at that point was 11-1 in favor of the Angels, and Darren O\'Day had just come in to pitch. It seems that after I turned the radio off on the drive home, the Orioles had gone error happy and that, combined with an intentional walk, a stolen base, and four singles had resulted in four more runs and a 9-1 Angels lead. The hits kept on coming in the fifth inning when new pitcher Kevin Gregg got the first two outs then loaded the bases on two singles and a walk. Gregg then got Morales to hit a ground ball to second base that looked like it would be the final out. But Brian Roberts let the ball go through his legs and two more runs scored. Oh, Brian. So with the score 11-1 I watched Darren O\'Day give up a double to Bobby Wilson to start the sixth inning. That was all I needed to switch to something new. The boyfriend and I have been working our way through The X-Files so we thought an episode of that would be better than seeing the Angels score more runs. We\'re in the third season and the episode we watched was titled Oubliette. The plot revolved around a girl who had been abducted (by a pedophile, not an alien) years ago going through the same trauma that the current abductee was facing. Of course Mulder figured out what was happening right away, as he tends to do. It wasn\'t the best episode in that outstanding series, but just like The Great Escape before it, was preferable to the game.    While we were mocking the wardrobe of early X-Files Scully, O\'Day struck out Trout and Hunter to get two outs, but then gave up back-to-back RBI hits to Peter Bourjos and Morales to give the final score of 13-1. Dana Eveland, fresh off paternity leave, pitched two scoreless innings to close out the game. You may have noticed that I haven\'t mentioned the Orioles offense since the second paragraph. Well, that\'s because it sucked. J.J. Hardy almost homered but was robbed by a sensational catch from Trout. Angels starter Jered Weaver held the Orioles to 6 hits over 6 2/3 innings, and five of those hits were singles. Former Orioles LaTroy Hawkins pitched 2/3 of an inning without allowing a baserunner, and David Carpenter finished it up. As our episode of TXF ended and we went back to the game, we saw Rick Dempsey and Tom Davis on the set of O\'s extra with the scoreboard glowing 13-1 behind them. Not a bad game to miss, really.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Los Angeles Angels aren't particular about how they rack up the runs. Sometimes they'll knock the ball out of the park, and often they will simply move around the bases one at a time.The Angels did a little of both Wednesday night against the Baltimore Orioles, rolling to a 13-1 victory behind a 16-hit outburst that included 13 singles and a home run by Torii Hunter.One night after reaching season highs in homers and hits, Los Angeles set a season mark for runs in its most lopsided victory of 2012. The Angels totaled 20 runs and 33 hits during a two-game sweep - their sixth straight series win.''Look at how we've been hitting the ball over the last five or six days,'' manager Mike Scioscia said. ''Not only are we hitting the ball for power and slugging percentage, but we have also been moving them around, running the bases better and driving in runs. Right now you're starting to see a team that is coming into its own and beginning to play at a high level.''Since starting 6-14, the Angels are 36-19. They've won 13 of their last 17 games overall and 13 of 14 on the road, outscoring the opposition by a combined 81-37.''We're a different team than we were 45 days ago,'' Scioscia said.Hunter scored four runs, Kendrys Morales had three hits and four RBIs, and Mike Trout had four hits and scored three runs. In addition, Alberto Callaspo had two hits in a six-run fourth that made it 9-1.The 36-year-old Hunter is delighted to be part of an offense that includes the 20-year-old Trout and 26-year-old Mark Trumbo.''I've had my glory. It's the young guys' time to shine,'' Hunter said. ''They're up and coming. I get chills playing with these guys. It's awesome.''Jered Weaver (8-1) scattered six hits over 6 2-3 innings in his second start since spending three weeks on the disabled list with a lower back strain. He received ample offensive backing from the entire Los Angeles lineup.''You still want to go out there and keep them off balance,'' said the right-hander, who gave up one run, walked one and struck out six.Weaver lowered his ERA to 2.31 and became the seventh pitcher in club history to win 90 games. The two-time All-Star is 90-48 in six-plus seasons.Orioles starter Jason Hammel (8-3) began the game with a streak of 19 straight innings without allowing an earned run, but he never made it to 20. The right-hander gave up eight runs and eight hits in 3 1-3 innings, his shortest outing of the season. His ERA ballooned from 2.61 to 3.29.''Good-hitting ballclub, not necessarily power but just putting it in play,'' Hammel said of the Angels. ''They're going to put the bat on the ball and put it in play somewhere, and that's what happened tonight.''Wilson Betemit had three hits for the Orioles, who have lost six of eight. Baltimore has scored only 12 runs during that slide. After going 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position, the Orioles are 2 for 47 in that situation over the last nine games.Los Angeles set the tone in the first inning when Hunter hit a solo shot into the left-field seats, the first home run off Hammel in five starts since May 30.In the bottom half, Trout made a sensational leaping catch at the center-field wall to rob J.J. Hardy of a homer.''One of the best plays I have seen behind me,'' Weaver said. ''Obviously very uplifting, and I played off of that. The offense did the rest.''Chris Davis followed with a two-out single to end an 0-for-29 drought and Adam Jones hit an RBI double, but that was the extent of Baltimore's attack.Los Angeles went up 3-1 in the third. Hammel retired the first two batters, then gave up a single and two walks to load the bases for Morales, who grounded a two-run single up the middle.The Angels' six-run fourth was their most prolific inning of the season. The uprising was fueled by two errors and featured RBI singles by Howie Kendrick, Trout, Hunter and Morales.Los Angeles made it 11-1 in the fifth, scoring two runs on a two-out error by second baseman Brian Roberts. In the seventh, Peter Bourjos doubled in a run and scored on a single by Morales.NOTES: Orioles DH Nick Johnson left the game with an injured right wrist. ...

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Cleveland Indians found the perfect way to end a bothersome losing streak, and it had little to do with a clubhouse meeting or manager Manny Acta's ability as a motivational speaker.Seems as if there's nothing like a trio of long balls to get a team back on track.Johnny Damon and Asdrubal Cabrera hit three-run homers, Shin-Soo Choo had a solo shot, and the Indians beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-2 Thursday night to end a five-game skid.Damon's home run put the Indians up 3-0 in the second inning, Choo made it 4-0 and Cabrera provided the clincher in the seventh.''Johnny Damon's three-run homer ... pretty much set the tone for us and gave us some relief from the get-go,'' Acta said. ''It was an early lead, and that Cabrera homer was huge, something that we really needed. Choo, obviously. It feels good that we were able to have good at-bats against a left-handed pitcher today.''Cleveland came in 5-16 against left-handed starters, but the Indians had their way against Orioles lefty Wei-Yin Chen (7-4).J.J. Hardy homered for the Orioles, who have lost seven of nine. Baltimore has scored only 14 runs during that span and is 3 for 52 with runners in scoring position over the last 10 games, including 1 for 5 in this one.Acta held a closed-door meeting before the game to make sure his players had the proper mind-set following their five-game losing streak.Asked what he told the team, Acta replied, ''It's a very long season, a roller coaster where you go up and down. It's about staying positive, sticking together and just making sure that you do what you're supposed to do and not panic.''The Indians responded by coming within one home run of their season high. That, combined with an effective outing by rookie Zach McAllister, put Cleveland back over the .500 mark at 38-37.''We haven't been swinging the bats so well,'' Damon said. ''We got three (runs) in the second ... added another run with Choo's homer, and then Cabrera just topped it off for us. It's been a while since we've hit the long ball. The long ball puts runs on the board, and that's what it did today.''And what of the closed-door session?''The most important thing with the meeting is to understand slumps happen in this game,'' Damon said.Recalled from Triple-A Columbus before the game, McAllister allowed two runs and seven hits over 5 2-3 innings to earn his second big league win. McAllister (2-1) struck out six and walked one in his fifth career start.''It's definitely exciting to be back up and get off to a good start,'' the right-hander said.Chen gave up six runs, six hits (including two homers) and three walks in 6 1-3 innings. The six runs, as well as the two homers, matched the most he's yielded this season.''Every day, you got a different feel for your pitches. Today, I just don't feel it,'' Chen said through an interpreter.Baltimore didn't give him much offensive backing. Down 4-0, the Orioles closed to 4-2 in the fifth when Hardy connected after Ryan Flaherty singled. Hardy, who started the game in a 4-for-41 slump, also doubled in the first inning and finished 2 for 4.But Baltimore continued to struggle with men on base.''We definitely haven't been hitting with runners in scoring position lately but we've got to keep grinding,'' Hardy said. ''It's one of things where, the more you think about it, the more you try harder and harder. That's not what you need to do. It will turn around eventually.''The Indians pulled away in the seventh. After Lou Marson doubled and Choo walked, Luis Ayala replaced Chen and threw a 2-0 pitch that Cabrera drove over the right-field wall.NOTES: The Orioles placed DH Nick Johnson on the 15-day DL with a sprained right wrist and recalled OF Xavier Avery from Triple-A Norfolk. Avery started in LF and went 1 for 4. ... To make room for McAllister, Cleveland optioned LHP Scott Barnes to Columbus. ... Jake Arrieta (3-9) will start for the Orioles on Friday against 39-year-old Derek Lowe (7-6). Baltimore manager Buck Showalter has decided upon LHP Dana Eveland as his starter on Saturday. ...

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Given their play of late, the Baltimore Orioles couldn't possibly have expected to come out on the winning end of a high-scoring, back-and-forth duel.With some late-inning heroics, the Orioles did just that.Ryan Flaherty singled in the tiebreaking run in the seventh, Matt Wieters hit a three-run homer, and the Orioles broke out of their offensive funk with a 9-8 victory over the Cleveland Indians on Friday night.On a steamy night in which temperatures reached 100 degrees, both teams worked up a sweat circling the bases. Cleveland had a season-high 16 hits, but the Orioles scored just enough runs to secure their third win in 10 games.''It was a battle,'' Wieters said. ''We haven't been able to come out on top of those, and we really worked to get that win.''The defeat was costly for the Indians, and not just because they fell 3 1/2 games behind first-place Chicago in the AL Central. Cleveland lost third baseman Lonnie Chisenhall for 4-6 weeks with a broken bone in his right forearm. The injury occurred when he was hit by a pitch by Baltimore reliever Troy Patton.''I had a bad feeling about it,'' manager Manny Acta said. ''It's bad news for us, especially a young kid like him. It's always tough seeing a young guy getting his feet wet, getting better and then all of a sudden, an injury like that.''Chris Davis started the Orioles' seventh-inning uprising with a two-out single off Joe Smith (5-2). After Wieters walked, Flaherty delivered an RBI single to right.Xavier Avery hit his first major league homer in the eighth to make it 9-7.''When I looked up and I saw it go out, I just started smiling,'' he said.The Orioles went 3 for 12 with runners in scoring position after going 3 for 52 in that situation over their previous 10 games. It was the first time in 11 games that Baltimore scored more than three runs.''I was so proud of the guys tonight. They just kept grinding,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''They were not going to be denied.''Matt Lindstrom (1-0) got the last out in the top of the seventh, Pedro Strop worked a perfect eighth and Jim Johnson earned his 23rd save despite giving up a ninth-inning run.Wieters and Asdrubal Cabrera of the Indians both homered onto Eutaw Street, located in front of the B&O Warehouse and far beyond the right-field wall. It was only the second time in the 21-year history of Camden Yards that two balls landed on Eutaw Street in the same game; Rafael Palmeiro did it twice on April 11, 1997.The Orioles trailed 5-4 before Wieters connected against Derek Lowe in the sixth inning. The lead vanished in the seventh, when the Indians pulled even on an RBI double by Shelley Duncan and a run-scoring double play.Duncan entered in the fifth as a pinch runner for Chisenhall.Orioles starter Jake Arrieta gave up five runs and eight hits in 3 2-3 innings, but Baltimore's comeback enabled him to avoid becoming the first 10-game loser in the majors this season.Lowe allowed seven runs, four earned, in 5 1-3 innings. The right-hander has allowed seven runs in three of his past five starts and is 0-3 in that span.Three of the first four Cleveland batters got hits in the first inning, including an RBI single by Michael Brantley.After going six straight games without an error, Cleveland made two in the bottom half that led to three unearned runs. Brian Roberts reached on a poor throw by first baseman Casey Kotchman and scored when shortstop Cabrera mishandled an RBI grounder by J.J. Hardy. Wilson Betemit followed with a run-scoring double.Cabrera hit his 11th home run, the second in two games, to make it 3-2 in the third.A fielding gaffe by the Orioles fueled a three-run fourth that put Cleveland up 5-3. After Kotchman hit a leadoff single, Flaherty backed away from a fly ball to right-center hit by Chisenhall, thinking center fielder Adam Jones would make the catch. The ball dropped between the two for a single, setting the stage for a bases-loaded walk to Shin-Soo Choo and a two-run single by Jason Kipnis that ended Arrieta's night.''I got our starter knocked out in the fourth inning because of that,'' Flaherty said. ''Fortunately, we were able to rally around it and come back from it, but still that's not winning baseball.''Baltimore closed to 5-4 in the fifth when Robert Andino walked, stole second and scored on a groundout by Avery.NOTES: Roberts snapped a 0-for-16 skid with a second-inning single. He also scored for the first time in 12 games. ... Patton's run of seven straight scoreless outings ended. ... Acta said C Carlos Santana (sore back) will likely be held out of the lineup until Sunday and will return as a DH. Santana hasn't played since Wednesday. ... Betemit had his fifth straight multihit game. ... Dana Eveland will start for Baltimore on Saturday against Josh Tomlin, who's 1-3 with a 6.75 ERA this month. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 9, Indians 8: Finally - Camden Chat', ""  Note: I apologize for lateness of this recap, but just about twenty minutes after the O's game ended, I lost power due to the storm that rolled through. I hope you can forgive me. And if not, what's your problem, jerk? Also, I wrote this while the power was out so PaulFolk and I reconstructed the entire thing from memory. Not too shabby! (although certainly not my best work ever)  The Orioles scored nine runs tonight, which is as many runs as they scored in the previous five games combined. I can only hope this is them breaking out of their ridiculous offensive slump, because it's hard to watch. Let's get the bad stuff out way first: Jake Arrieta. Arrieta gave up eight hits in just 3 2/3 innings, resulting in five runs. Arrieta was not good tonight, but he was also let down some by his defense (when isn't an O's pitcher let down by defense?). The defense wasn't the problem in the first inning (at least not for the Orioles), when Arrieta gave up three singles which resulted in one run. Nor was it in the third, when Asdrubal homered to lead off the inning. But in his fourth and final inning, well. First Arrieta gave up a single to Casey Kotchman, then Lonnie Chisenhall hit a fly ball to right-center. Neither Adam Jones nor Ryan Flaherty took control of the situation and it fell in for a single.  After Lou Marson singled back up the middle to load the bases, Arrieta proceeded to walk Shin-Soo Choo. Yes, a bases-loaded walk. A two-out single by Jason Kipnis later and Arrieta was finished for the night. He was replaced by lefty Troy Patton, who walked Michael Brantley but retired Johnny Damon to end the inning.    So Arrieta was bad. But Patton was not! He did give up a run in 2 1/3 innings, but it scored after he left the game.    But the Orioles weren't the only team on the field with shaky defense, no sir. The Indians were a giant mess in the first inning. Brian Roberts hit a ball to first baseman Casey Kotchman. Kotchman made a pretty good play to field it, but his throw went past Derek Lowe who was covering first, allowing Roberts to go to second. Xavier Avery moved Roberts over on a ground ball to second, then J.J. Hardy hit a ground ball to Asdrubal Cabrera. Roberts was running on contact and would have scored even if it had been a ground out. But Cabrera took his eye off the ball and it went past him for an error. Roberts scored, Hardy was safe, and the Orioles had tied the game at one.    Cleanup hitter Adam Jones hit the ball about five feet between the pitcher and catcher, but there was some miscommunication and he ended up safe at first (scored a hit). That set the table for the red-hot Wilson Betemit. Betemit hit what looked like a home run, but it ended up falling just a few feet short. Hardy scored and Jones ended up on third, where he'd score on a ground out by Chris Davis. Down by two runs in the fifth, the Orioles manufactured a run without a hit. Robert Andino led off with a walk and then stole second base. Brian Roberts couldn't knock him in with a hit, but he did ground out to second, allowing Andino to move to third. Another groundout, this one by Avery, brought Andino home. But the bottom of the sixth inning, that's when the fun started. Derek Lowe was still in the game for the Indians, but not for long. Betemit and Davis both singled, bringing Matt Wieters to the plate. Wieters didn't waste any time, as he homered on the first pitch Lowe threw him. And it was a monster shot. A no doubter. It landed on Eutaw Street, giving the Orioles a 7-5 lead. On the other side of the ball, Patton was rolling. But after the first batter he faced in the top of the seventh inning reached on a cheap hit, Buck Showalter pulled him for Darren O'Day. It turned out to be a bad idea as O'Day was not on his game. He gave up four hits and allowed his inherited runner to score along with one of his own. Just like that the game was tied 7-7, and it just figures that in a game when the offense finally comes alive the Orioles pitching can't keep it together! Matt Lindstrom came in to get one out and finish the inning for O'Day, preserving the tie. Thankfully, the Orioles were able to untie it in the bottom half of the inning.  With two outs and nobody on, Davis hit a blooper that fell in for a single. Indians pitcher then clearly pitched around Wieters, and with Ryan Flaherty on deck it's hard to blame him. But Flaherty made him pay! He went the other way and hit a ground ball through the hole wide of first base. Davis raced around third and headed home as Indians right fielder Choo fired home. It looked like the ball beat Davis but Marson couldn't get a tag on him, and the O's were up 8-7. Pedro Strop pitched a phenomenal eighth inning, needing just five pitches (all strikes) to retire the side in order. That five-pitch inning included  a strikeout. Wow. The Orioles added an insurance run (that they ended up needing) in the eighth inning thanks to Xavier Avery hitting his first major league home run, a modest but not cheap shot to left field. Good job, Xavery! And he hit it off of Indians closer Chris Perez, who is quite good. With a two-run lead, Jim Johnson came in to shut it down, but he had some troubles. Shelley Duncan, who I am always surprised to see still playing baseball, hit a leadoff single and moved to second on a slow ground out to second. After Marson struck out on a filthy pitch from JJ, Choo knocked a single that scored Duncan. Thank goodness for Xavery's homer! And speaking of Xavery, with the dangerous Asdrubal Cabrera at the plate representing the go-ahead run, JJ induced a fly ball to him in left to end the game. Nice win by the O's (the offense at least)! Let's keep those bats alive for the rest of the series, ok boys?

The Orioles had just traded two minor leaguers for likely Hall-of-Fame slugger Jim Thome, who is expected to join the team here Sunday and be the club\'s regular, left-handed designated hitter. It\'s a straight trade, with the Orioles picking up the remainder of Thome\'s $1.25 million salary for 2012. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you have an opportunity to add him to the mix, you always want to try to do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles manager Buck Showalter. \xe2\x80\x9cHats off to our minor league departments and scouting to have the type of players that can bring him over here.\xe2\x80\x9d var adSkipCounter = 0;  After roughly a week of negotiations, the Orioles sent minor league catcher Gabriel Lino and right-handed pitcher Kyle Simon to the Philadelphia Phillies in exchange for the 41-year-old Thome, who has 609 career home runs, but has been relegated to a pinch-hitting role in the National League. \xe2\x80\x9cJim Thome is a real pro,"" said Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette. ""And he specializes in hitting home runs and getting on base. He has done that consistently. Beyond that, he is a terrific teammate, a steady presence and he is a veteran. He has been around the league and he has been in a pennant race and in the playoffs. I like all those things that he brings to our team. I think he gives us a little more depth to our lineup with the injuries to our left-handed hitters.\xe2\x80\x9d In 30 games with the Phillies, he hit .242 with five homers and 15 RBIs and is a lifetime .277 hitter with a .402 career on-base percentage. He was 12-for-36 with four homers in nine interleague games as the Phillies\' DH. \xe2\x80\x9cYou\'ve got to look at this guy\'s presence. He\'s going to help in the lineup, he\'s going to protect some people in the lineup and he still can hit the ball out of the ballpark,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles first base coach Wayne Kirby, who played with Thome in Cleveland from 1991 to 1996. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he comes from a National League team like Philly and doesn\'t play as much, then in interleague play he starts hitting.\xe2\x80\x9d He\'s also considered one of the best character guys in the game. ""Class A. Goes about the game the right way. Professional,\xe2\x80\x9d Kirby said. \xe2\x80\x9cTreats everyone with respect, and he will help you.\xe2\x80\x9d Thome\'s 1,689 RBIs are second most for any active player behind only New York\'s Alex Rodriguez and are 25th all-time. His next home run will break a tie with former Oriole Sammy Sosa for seventh all-time in that category. So far this season, Showalter has eschewed having an everyday DH for using the spot among multiple players. Eight different Orioles have started at DH in 2012, with Chris Davis and the injured Nick Johnson making the most starts there \xe2\x80\x94 19 each. But, heading into Saturday, the Orioles\' DHs were eighth in the AL in average, eighth in homers, 11th in RBIs and ninth in slugging percentage. Additionally, the team was hitting just .235 with a .296 on-base percentage against right-handed pitching \xe2\x80\x94 something Thome should improve. \xe2\x80\x9cI think everybody in baseball has been a fan of Jim, the way he carries himself and conducts himself,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe most important thing is, this is a guy that can help us with some things between the lines and outside the lines.\xe2\x80\x9d Simon, the Orioles\' fourth-round pick last season out of the Arizona, was 2-8 with a 3.96 ERA in 14 starts this season at High-A Frederick. A 21-year-old right-hander, Simon rebounded from a rough opening month with the Keys \xe2\x80\x94 he was 0-4 with a 5.61 ERA in five April starts \xe2\x80\x94 but is 2-4 with a 3.06 ERA in nine starts since. He was drafted by former Orioles\' scouting director Joe Jordan, who is now the player development director with the Phillies. The Orioles also were very high on Lino, a 6-foot-3 catcher out of Maracay, Venezuela \xe2\x80\x94 Showalter mentioned him as a promising player earlier this season. After hitting .282 in the Gulf Coast League last year, the 19-year-old Lino was promoted to Low-A Delmarva this season, where he was hitting .218 with 13 doubles, four homers and 18 RBI in 56 games. \xe2\x80\x9cWe thought that Thome\'s presence and our need for the Major League team were worth the value that we have to give up in a trade,\xe2\x80\x9d Duquette said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe like both of the young players, they\'re both in A ball, and we need some help to bolster our (big-league) lineup.\xe2\x80\x9d Baltimore Sun reporter Eduardo A.

''Especially Choo and a couple of guys who got three, two hits. Maybe we start today and (continue) tomorrow and a week before the All-Star break.''The Indians stranded 16 runners and went 7 for 22 with runners in scoring position - and it hardly mattered.''We swung the bat well today, especially the top two guys in our lineup. They set the table the whole day,'' manager Manny Acta said. ''Choo had a great day and Cabby had some huge at-bats, too. Between Lopez and the guys back there, they just cleaned them up. It was important to get all those runs because we haven't been shutting teams down as effectively of late.''Cleveland right-hander Josh Tomlin (4-5), who allowed five runs and seven hits in six innings, rightfully credited the offense for the victory.''That was the story of the game,'' Tomlin said. ''That's the reason we win the ballgame. Guys came out with a plan and they executed it and kept it rolling.''In the first three games of this four-game series, Choo is 8 for 13 with two home runs, six RBIs and seven runs scored. He reached base five times in this one, including a walk.''I think the big thing (is) I feel comfortable, comfortable in the batter's box,'' he said. ''I have confidence. I'm not changing anything.''Chris Davis homered for the Orioles, who have lost eight of 11. During the game, Baltimore announced the acquisition of slugger Jim Thome from Philadelphia for two minor leaguers.Thome, who has 609 career homers, went 6 for 13 with four RBIs in a three-game series against Baltimore earlier this season.''I've heard nothing but great things about his character and personality,'' Davis said. ''He's a class act. So we're going to welcome him with open arms, and hopefully he can swing it for us like he can against us.''The Indians took an 8-4 lead with a three-run fifth. Marson tripled and scored on a two-out single by Choo, who came home on a double by Cabrera. Lopez capped the uprising with an RBI single.Duncan led off the sixth with his fifth home run, and Choo hit an RBI single for a six-run cushion.Orioles starter Dana Eveland (0-1) gave up five runs in 3 2-3 innings. He was followed by Tommy Hunter, who yielded five runs and eight hits in 1 2-3 innings.Cleveland took a 1-0 lead in an eventful first inning that featured an excellent running catch by Orioles left fielder Xavier Avery and an RBI single by Lopez that bounced off third base. Eveland avoided further damage by working out of a bases-loaded, one-out jam.Choo homered in the second to make it 2-0. Seven of his eight homers have been solo shots.After Baltimore got a third-inning run on a sacrifice fly by Brian Roberts, both teams scored three runs in the fourth.Cabrera hit an RBI single, Jason Kipnis chased Eveland with a run-scoring groundout and Lopez drove in a run with a single off the glove of shortstop J.J.

His 609 homers are tied with Sammy Sosa for seventh place on the career list, and his 1,689 RBIs over a 22-year career are 25th all-time.Thome will move right into the designated hitter role with the Orioles, who have been a surprising contender in the AL East. Out for much of the season with a lower back strain, Thome didn\'t figure to see much time in the field for the slumping Phillies. He also had struggled as a pinch hitter.""There\'s a part of me that\'s happy to go and get a chance to play a little bit. Baltimore is having a nice year and it will be exciting to go over there and try to help those guys win and get some at-bats. I\'m excited about that, for sure,"" Thome said.""There\'s always emotions when you\'re traded because you have so much respect for the Phillies organization,"" he said.In 30 games for the Phillies this season, Thome hit .242 with five home runs and 15 RBIs. He missed more than a month with the back problem and the Phillies didn\'t want to risk having him get hurt again.""I think the disappointing thing for me is that I wasn\'t able to play as much first base as I thought,"" he said.As a DH, Thome can purely focus on hitting.""We felt Thome\'s presence and our need on the major league team were worth the value we have to give up in a trade,"" said Dan Duquette, the Orioles executive vice president of baseball operations.

I think his presence in the lineup will make the opposing pitchers work harder. Because he gets on base and hits home runs and can hit the ball out of any part of this ballpark, we think he\'ll be an asset to the team.""The Orioles got a good look at Thome earlier this month when he went 6 for 13 with four RBIs in a three-game series at Camden Yards. He also got his first home run and RBI of the year that weekend.Thome has done quite well in Baltimore over the years. In 67 career games at Camden Yards, he\'s hit 18 home runs \xe2\x80\x94 one every 13.6 at-bats \xe2\x80\x94 with 45 RBIs. Of the 65 homers to land on distant Eutaw Street in two decades, Thome has launched two of them.""I think everybody in baseball has been a fan of Jim, the way he carries himself and conducts himself,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said ""The most important thing is, this is a guy that can help us with some things between the lines and outside the lines. If you have an opportunity to add him to the mix, you always want to try to do it.""Phillies manager Charlie Manuel told him about the trade after a 3-2 loss at Miami in which Thome didn\'t play. At the time, the Orioles were still playing in an 11-5 loss to Cleveland.""I think it\'s going to give Jim a chance to get more at-bats. And at the end of this year it will give him a chance to see where he\'s at and what he wants to do,"" Manuel said.""Yes, it\'s difficult for me to see him go. But at the same time, you look at it from the aspect of what he can do. If he sits here on the bench, it\'s hard for him to keep his timing,"" he said.Baltimore will assume the rest of the one-year, $1.25 million contract he signed with Philadelphia in November 2011.The Orioles have scored more than three runs in two of their last 12 games and is averaging six hits over the last 14 contests. They have been struggling to produce with runners in scoring position, going 11 for 82 in that situation over a 14-game span.In addition, they were operating without injured DH Nick Johnson and outfielder Nolan Reimold.Baltimore will be Thome\'s sixth team. He previously played for Cleveland, Minnesota, the Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers and Phillies.""I think it\'s bittersweet, to be honest. Jim\'s a great teammate and I think we\'re all sorry to see him go but we\'re all excited that he\'ll have the opportunity to get at-bats daily. He can still do a lot of damage,"" Phillies second baseman Chase Utley said.Echoed Phillies pitcher Cole Hamels: ""He\'s one of the best guys in baseball and probably one of the most positive influences you could ever have just because he\'s been around the game.""""He\'s going to go to the Hall of Fame.

Maybe they are a little bit of both, but on the afternoon in which the Orioles learned they would send multiple players to the All-Star Game\xc2\xa0 for the first time since 2005, the team again resembled the also-rans that have been so prominent at Camden Yards in the last decade-plus. The Indians (40-38), who had dropped five straight before coming to Baltimore, outscored the Orioles 32-18 while winning three of four. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re fine,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles center fielder Adam Jones, who had two of the club\xe2\x80\x99s six hits Sunday. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are playing our [butts] off. These things happen. We are not playing our best baseball. But we are still in it. We are not pushing ourselves out of it.\xe2\x80\x9d The root problem for the Orioles is a sudden inability for their starters to get outs and go deep into games. In their past six contests, the Orioles rotation has lasted just 26 innings, allowed 48 hits and has posted an 11.42 ERA. Matusz (5-10) is the most alarming example of a rotation gone wrong. He served up two homers and five runs (four earned) in just four-plus innings. In his past five starts, spanning just 21 1/3 innings, Matusz has allowed 40 hits, 13 walks and 20 earned runs for an 8.44 ERA. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\xe2\x80\x99s not the only guy that\xe2\x80\x99s had some struggles,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t want to hang it all on Brian. We\xe2\x80\x99ve had some other people that, just statistically looking at it, you know they\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be better.\xe2\x80\x9d Matusz, whose ERA climbed to 5.42 while tying the league lead in losses, becomes the second member of the rotation to be sent down in less than 24 hours. Tommy Hunter, who was 3-4 with a 6.11 ERA in 15 games (13 starts) was sent to Norfolk on Saturday night. Jake Arrieta and Dana Eveland, who made a spot start Saturday, are clinging to tenuous rotation slots. \xe2\x80\x9cWithout stating the obvious, what\xe2\x80\x99s going on is not good enough. It\xe2\x80\x99s not good enough,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cI got it. They got it, too. Nobody knows better than Brian and nobody knows better than Dana and Jake and some of the other guys. It\xe2\x80\x99s a competitive place for you, me. We have to bring what we need to bring.\xe2\x80\x9d For now, the Orioles will recall a reliever to take Matusz\xe2\x80\x99s space on the roster and provide more depth in the bullpen, especially with Miguel Gonzalez, who was promoted Sunday and forced to go 4 1/3 innings in relief of Matusz. \xe2\x80\x9cI think the team needs better pitching and I believe that Brian can pitch better,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles executive vice president Dan Duquette. \xe2\x80\x9cWith a couple adjustments that we can help him make at Triple-A, we should be able to get him back on track.\xe2\x80\x9d But rotation changes seem impending, with both lefty Zach Britton and Chris Tillman available at Norfolk. Duquette said he would look internally first for solutions to the rotation \xe2\x80\x94 though he said Gonzalez wasn\xe2\x80\x99t one right now \xe2\x80\x94 before seriously exploring outside alternatives.1 | 2 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: A mixed bag of results - birdswatcher.com', 'First and foremost, the Orioles dropped game three of a four game set to Cleveland yesterday 11-5. Cleveland bats have really feasted on Oriole pitching thus far this series. Dana Eveland made a spot start out of the bullpen and pitched 3.2 innings giving up five runs over six hits, walking two and striking out five. Eveland didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to have too much pizzazz on his pitches, and the same can be said for Tommy Hunter who followed Eveland in the game. Both pitchers\xe2\x80\x99 pitches were sailing high into the zone with little to no movement; prime and ready for the picking. Part of the issue this entire series has been that Shin-Soo Choo has hit the Orioles hard from the lead 0ff spot, going 8-for-13 thus far. That sets the tone for the rest of the lineup, which has followed suit.However all was not lost yesterday for the Orioles. That might be a difficult statement to justify given that the lost the game, but work with me folks. The fans that have been screaming for more cowbell\xc2\xa0all season long are getting their wish starting today. As the game wore on news of a trade started to sprinkle throughout Camden Yards. The Orioles traded P Kyle Simon and C Gabrielle Lino to Philadelphia for veteran slugger Jim Thome, who\xe2\x80\x99s expected to be in uniform at Camden Yards in time for this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game. First off, both Simon and Lino are low-level prospects, with low ceilings. (And keep in mind that in Lino\xe2\x80\x99s case he\xe2\x80\x99s a catcher in a system that currently has a young gold glove catcher at the major league level.) Secondly, the name Jim Thome speaks for itself. He\xe2\x80\x99s only hitting .242 for the season, but he\xe2\x80\x99s also only played in 30 games thus far for Philadelphia. He had a whale of a series at the yard against the Orioles several weeks ago, and he\xe2\x80\x99s always hit well at Camden Yards.The issue of course is that Thome will clog up the DH spot for the most part, forcing the Orioles to continue their parade of fielders in different spots more so than they have thus far in the season. Yesterday we saw Chris Davis have a tough time digging balls out of the right field corner, which led to Cleveland base runners getting extra bases. However the O\xe2\x80\x99s also had some fluky things happen to them in this game, not all of which were anyone\xe2\x80\x99s fault. The tone for the game was set early on when Eveland\xe2\x80\x99s first two pitches went for base hits. Jose Lopez then hit a dribbler to third, which Ryan Flaherty was in position to field cleanly\xe2\x80\xa6had the ball not hit the bag and popped over his head. Some things you have to chalk up to dumb luck, however of course some people would say that dumb luck seems to find those who aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing well to begin with.Trailing 5-1 in the fourth, Chris Davis got the Birds right back into the game with a three-run homer. However that ended the productive part of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 day at the plate, as Cleveland just kept piling on runs. However I think that the aquisition of Thome immediately stole the spotlight from whatever ill might have come from this game. Incidentally, the Orioles also honored longtime manager and MLB hall of famer Earl Weaver with his statue unveiling before the game. (Wow, this is a lot to work into one measly game recap!) Weaver of course believed in pitching, good defense, and the three-run homer. So maybe that\xe2\x80\x99s why the Birds aquired Thome yesterday? Always a possibility!As I said, Thome is expected to be in uniform for the Orioles today, and he will presumably DH (we won\xe2\x80\x99t know that for sure until the lineup is announced). Thome will potentially add some support to the top of the lineup, along with Adam Jones. He\xe2\x80\x99ll also add some pop to the bottom of the order, as he\xe2\x80\x99ll probably push the likes of Chris Davis and Matt Wieters a bit lower in the lineup. Thome isn\xe2\x80\x99t the power-hitter that he was ten years ago, but he still has some pop in his bat and he could potentially help a team like the Orioles who are trying to prove to the world that they can at least be competitive in the playoff race deep into the season.Tommy Hunter was optioned to triple-A Norfolk after yesterday\xe2\x80\x99s game to make room for Thome on the roster, however there might be another roster move forthcoming. Miguel Gonzalez was removed from the lineup at Norfolk yesterday, and is presumably headed back to Baltimore. We\xe2\x80\x99ll know for sure before today\xe2\x80\x99s game. The Orioles need for Brian Matusz to go deep into today\xe2\x80\x99s game due to the fact that the bullpen is looking a bit tired and they\xe2\x80\x99ve been overused the past couple of days. Too add further urgency, the Orioles fly out to Seattle immediately following the game, and that\xe2\x80\x99s a rough enough trip with a rested bullpen. Matusz will be opposed by Justin Masterson, who gave up four runs over six innings on Tuesday in NY. However he has a 1.55 ERA in his last four starts. Jim Thome can\xe2\x80\x99t get to the Orioles soon enough!Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

07/03/2012,"[('Wells leads Mariners past Orioles 6-3 - Yahoo', ""View photosSeattle Mariners' Chone Figgins slides past home after scoring against the Baltimore Orioles in the third inning of a baseball game Monday, July 2, 2012, in Seattle. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)MoreSEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners have struggled to score at home this season, so this one was particularly nice.Casper Wells hit a go-ahead, three-run double with two out in the seventh inning and the Mariners beat the slumping Baltimore Orioles 6-3 on Monday night.Miguel Olivo and Dustin Ackley added back-to-back homers in the eighth as the Mariners rallied to win their first game of the season against Baltimore.''You get a starter late in the ballgame there you're hoping you get a mistake or a pitch to hit and I think we got a couple of those but the fact of the matter is you still have to hit them,'' Seattle manager Eric Wedge said. ''I think that's been our biggest issue. I don't think it's been a situation of we haven't had pitches to hit.''Scoring at Safeco Field has been a constant problem all season for Seattle. The six runs were the Mariners' most at home since June 16 and only the second time they reached that number in Seattle since May 21. While the Mariners' lineup has been respectable on the road, they entered Monday night hitting below .200 at home.Seattle appeared to be headed for more of the same until it used a pair of walks, a single and Wells' clutch hit to move in front against Jason Hammel (8-4) in the seventh. Being better in circumstances like the seventh was something Wells focused on when he was demoted to the minors in late May.''In big situations before I would try and do too much and in situations now I focus on being aggressive and getting a good pitch to hit and it's been successful so far,'' Wells said.Ackley started the seventh with a walk and stole second when Hammel struck out Chone Figgins on a 3-2 pitch. Ackley advanced to third on Munenori Kawasaki's single, but Brendan Ryan fouled out when catcher Matt Wieters made the catch at the edge of the top step of the Mariners' dugout. Ichiro Suzuki walked to load the bases and Wells followed with a liner that gave Seattle a 4-3 lead.Wells picked up his first RBIs since June 20 at Arizona and atoned for striking out with a runner on second in the third inning.''I did exactly what I wanted, started him with a fastball away and then a slider off the plate, what we had been doing all night,'' Hammel said. ''He changed his approach and went out and got it.''Olivo hit his seventh homer against Troy Patton and Ackley drove the next pitch over the wall in right for his fifth of the season. It was the second set of consecutive homers this season for Seattle.Chris Davis hit a three-run shot off Mariners starter Hisashi Iwakuma in the fourth, but that accounted for all of Baltimore's offense. After Davis' 14th homer, the Orioles got just three baserunners against Iwakuma, Steve Delabar (2-1), Shawn Kelley and Tom Wilhelmsen. Delabar worked two innings, striking out three. Kelley struck out a pair in the eighth and Wilhelmsen worked the ninth for his seventh save in eight chances.Seattle took a 1-0 lead in the third when the unlikely trio of Figgins, Kawasaki and Ryan - none of whom entered the night hitting higher than .186 - combined to plate the first run. Figgins led off with a single, moved up on Kawasaki's sacrifice and scored on Ryan's single to center.Ryan was stranded at second and Seattle wasted another opportunity in the sixth. Wells' one-out single was followed by John Jaso's double that should have been caught by Steve Pearce in left, but glanced off his glove. With runners at second and third, Kyle Seager hit a tapper in front of the plate and Olivo struck out.Iwakuma was making a spot start with Kevin Millwood still nursing a sore groin that has twice forced him to leave starts early in the past month. Iwakuma threw five innings, giving up just three hits. But he made the one critical mistake to Davis on a 1-0 pitch.''I thought he did a really nice job today. One bad pitch got him, but he settled down and kept pitching out of that,'' Wedge said. ''A lot of people asked what I expected out of him and I said just give us a chance to win the ballgame.''NOTES: The Mariners had three Japanese players in the starting lineup - Suzuki, Kawasaki and Iwakuma - for the first time in major league history. ... Seattle signed first-round draft pick C Mike Zunino. Zunino was taken with the No. 3 overall pick in June's amateur draft. He will be introduced at a news conference on Tuesday. ...

Encina | The Baltimore SunSEATTLE \xe2\x80\x94 The only thing forgiving to the Orioles on Monday night in Seattle was the official scorer at Safeco Field.The Orioles were only charged with one error \xe2\x80\x93 raising their major league high to 70 -- in their 6-3 loss to the Mariners. But anyone staying up past the late local news to watch Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s comedy of non-errors knows that wasn\'t a true indication of how horrible the team\'s fielding was.If you dozed off on the couch before the sixth inning, consider yourself lucky. What you missed was sure to give you nightmares. var adSkipCounter = 0; One thing was for sure: starter Jason Hammel deserved the win, but the Orioles defense let him down. He had retired seven straight through the middle innings until Robert Andino\xe2\x80\x99s fielding error put a man on base in the fifth.Then, left fielder Steve Pearce\'s play on John Jaso\xe2\x80\x99s fly ball in the sixth was by no means routine, but as Pearce neared the warning track, he closed his glove before the ball was inside \xe2\x80\x93 a ball that was ruled a double -- forcing Hammel to work out\xc2\xa0 of a jam with runners at second and third and one out.But the backbreaker came in the seventh. With Dustin Ackley on first, the Orioles had a perfectly executed strike-him-out, throw-him-out double play. After Hammel struck out Chone Figgins, Matt Wieters pinpointed a pefect throw to second to get Ackley.But Andino simply dropped the ball. No error was charged.\xe2\x80\x9cThe strike-him-out, throw-him-out changed the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Andino said late. \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have just been different. It would have been\xc2\xa0 nobody on. It would have been from the windup. It changed the whole game when I dropped that ball.\xe2\x80\x9dIt should have been Andino\xe2\x80\x99s 12th error of the season, which would have tied him with Wilson Betemit for the team lead. Instead it went unmarked in the scorecard, but it was a catalyst to the Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 three-run seventh.After the game, Orioles manager Buck Showalter defended his team, specifically Andino.\xe2\x80\x9cHe just dropped the ball,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cRobert\xe2\x80\x99s made that play in his sleep and made great tags. One of the reasons we are where we are is because of how well Robert\xe2\x80\x99s played at second base while (Brian Roberts has) been out. To sit here and think I\xe2\x80\x99m going to beat up on him, he\xe2\x80\x99s been solid for us at second. Probably the key to the game, we had three hits. You\xe2\x80\x99re not going to do a lot.\xe2\x80\x9dHammel took the blame as well. He had four three-ball counts \xe2\x80\x93 including two walks \xe2\x80\x93 that inning. But those walks might not have happened with the bases empty.Showalter pressed that it was the lack of offense that lost the game. And on most nights over the past half-month, he would be right. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 .192 average since June 15 is the only number you need to prove that.And even though the Orioles didn\xe2\x80\x99t have a hit after Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99 three-run homer in the fourth, they wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t have needed any had they played fundamental baseball.Showalter was right in this \xe2\x80\x93 the Orioles are leaving themselves little margin for error \xe2\x80\x93 and when they leave the door open for other teams, they\xe2\x80\x99re often going to get burned. \xc2\xa0A Seattle team that is 11 games under .500 and has the third-worst team batting average in baseball did it Monday, but imagine how the Yankees, Red Sox and Rays will capitalize come the second half of the season if the Orioles don\xe2\x80\x99t correct the error \xe2\x80\x93 no pun intended \xe2\x80\x93 of their ways.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)MoreSEATTLE (AP) -- Robert Andino came up big at the right time for the Baltimore Orioles.A day after dropping a throw at second base that helped extend the seventh inning in a loss to Seattle, Andino homered in the top of the ninth to give the Orioles a 5-4 win Tuesday over the Mariners.''I had to make up for something from yesterday,'' Andino said.Andino's home run gave a boost to the Orioles. Baltimore starter Wei-Yin Chen was perfect for 6 1/3 innings, and left the game with a 4-1 lead.The Mariners rallied for three runs against reliever Pedro Strop to tie the game before Andino came through.His fourth homer of the year was his first since May 7 and ended Seattle reliever Charlie Furbush's (4-2) streak of 22 2-3 scoreless innings, the third longest by a reliever in Mariners' history.''It was a two-seamer I wanted to have sink and it stayed flat,'' Furbush said.Jim Johnson pitched a perfect ninth for his 24th save. Darren O'Day (5-0) pitched one-third of an inning, but picked up the win.Strop struggled in the eighth when the Mariners scored three runs and tied the game. Michael Saunders' double ended Chen's night. Strop faced Justin Smoak, who was 2-for-2 with a walk in his career against Strop.Smoak's single scored Saunders and John Jaso's pinch-hit single drove in Smoak following a Dustin Ackley single. Jaso is 4 for 10 this season pinch-hitting.Strop walked Kyle Seager with the bases loaded to force in the tying run, ending his night after just one-third of an inning in which he allowed three hits, hit a batter, walked one and gave up two earned runs. Strop had allowed two earned runs in his prior 26 appearances combined.Chen threw 7 1-3 innings, the first 6 1-3 perfect, allowed two hits and two earned runs while striking out a career-high nine. He said he didn't think about the perfect game.Casper Wells' seventh-inning home run to left on a 3-2 pitch ended Chen's perfect run.''I know you got to throw a strike - it's a perfect game - so I'm pretty much sitting dead red,'' Wells said. ''I got a fastball I could handle.''Chicago's Phil Humber threw a perfect game against Seattle on April 21.Smoak led off the sixth with a soft liner after Chen had an extended wait during the Orioles' four-run rally in the top of the inning. Ackley flew out to left and Brendan Ryan popped out in foul territory to catcher Matt Wieters.Chen was never threatened in the first five innings. He struck out eight, including the side in the fifth, working a 93-mph fastball with an 80-mph changeup. His strikeout of Miguel Olivo for the second out in the fifth set a career high in strikeouts.The Mariners managed only one out in the outfield through the first five innings when Ichiro Suzuki flew to left leading off the game.Ryan hit a line drive right back at Chen in the third that the left-hander snagged with his glove.Baltimore pounced on Seattle starter Felix Hernandez in the sixth for four runs and knocked him out of the game. The Orioles started the inning with four consecutive singles from Xavier Avery, J.J. Hardy, Chris Davis and Adam Jones. Jim Thome grounded out, but Wieters singled to center to score two runs and chase Hernandez.''It's really tough to string something against him,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ''You may get one or two shots at him in a ball game, and we took advantage of it.''Hernandez lasted 5 1-3 innings, and allowed four earned runs and eight hits. He struck out eight and walked none.The first run of the inning snapped a 20-inning scoreless streak for Hernandez, who will be participating in next week's All-Star game.The 2010 Cy Young winner had allowed two earned runs over his prior three starts combined. The four runs were more than the Orioles had scored in 13 of the previous 16 games.Ryan Flaherty's one-out single to right in the third was the first hit of the night off Hernandez. After Andino struck out, Avery, activated Tuesday, hit a broken-bat grounder to left that moved Flaherty to third. Hernandez powered out of trouble with a strikeout of Hardy, Hernandez's seventh strikeout in the first three innings.''There was a lot of opportunity there to give in and keel over, but Robert had a big swing for us after a couple tough things,'' Showalter said.Notes: Baltimore placed second baseman Brian Roberts on the 15-day disabled list Tuesday because of a strained right groin. Xavier Avery was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk. . Mariners manager Eric Wedge said Franklin Gutierrez, who is on the seven-day disabled list because of concussion symptoms, is unlikely to be back prior to the All-Star break. . Seattle's Mike Carp (shoulder) participated in batting practice Tuesday, and will be worked back in primarily at first base. He is yet to throw. . Seattle signed No. 3 overall pick Mike Zunino on Tuesday. Zunino and his family were at Safeco Field, and Zunino took batting practice, hitting a handful of home runs. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

(AP Photo/Elaine Thompson)MoreSEATTLE (AP) -- It's just coincidence the finest performance of Chris Tillman's young career with Baltimore came against his former organization.Whether it came against Seattle or anyone else, Tillman's effort Wednesday was satisfying and impressive.Tillman gave up just two hits in 8 1-3 innings in first start of the year, Adam Jones hit his 20th home run into the upper deck in left field, and the Orioles beat the Mariners 4-2.''Now I can sit back, it still hasn't come to me yet, but I'm happy. It was good,'' Tillman said. ''The way I felt, my command was OK and I definitely think we can move forward from here.''Jones' homer leading off the second inning came on a 2-0 pitch from Seattle starter Hector Noesi (2-11) and landed well back in the upper level seats. That was essentially all Tillman needed, as the one-time Seattle prospect shut down his former organization after getting called up from the minors.Tillman (1-0) took a one-hit shutout into the ninth only to see the Orioles' sloppy defense likely cost him a complete game. Michael Saunders reached on an Robert Andino's careless error and John Jaso's one-out double on Tillman's 125th pitch ended his day.Jim Johnson entered and gave up an RBI groundout to Kyle Seager and RBI single to Justin Smoak, but still finished off his major league-leading 25th save.Before Jaso's double the only hit Tillman allowed came in the fourth when Saunders singled up the middle just out of J.J. Hardy's reach. Tillman struck out seven and walked two and his velocity hovered in the mid-90s even into the ninth inning. He had never gone more than 7 1-3 innings in a major league start, but after retiring the first 10 batters Tillman set down 15 of the final 20 he faced. Both of the runs Seattle scored in the ninth were unearned.After the game, the Orioles optioned Tillman to Double-A Bowie, with the intent of starting him early next week during the All-Star break then bringing him back to Baltimore after the break.''What he did today is not new ... this is not uncharted territory for him. It's just it would be if he can consistently do it,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.Tillman was once a top prospect in the Mariners' farm system before being shipped along with Jones and three others to Baltimore in 2008 in exchange for Erik Bedard, a trade that backfired on the Mariners. Jones has developed into an All-Star, while Bedard spent four injury-plagued seasons in Seattle's organization.Tillman was a bit of a wild card in the deal. He was highly regarded by the Mariners, but his career with the Orioles hasn't met projections. Tillman was just 3-5 with a 5.52 ERA in 13 starts with Baltimore in 2011 and 8-8 with a 3.63 ERA at Triple-A Norfolk this season.He looked like he belonged in the Orioles' rotation against the Mariners meager offense. Tillman was perfect until Saunders' one-out single in the fourth inning. He was helped by Chris Davis' diving catch on Munenori Kawasaki's blooper in the third and kept his infield busy with 11 outs recorded by the infield.Tillman allowed just six baserunners total and two of those reached on errors in the eighth and ninth innings.''It's frustrating he couldn't finish it off because he had the stuff to pitch a complete game today,'' Showalter said.Davis and Andino added RBI singles for the Orioles, who won two straight for the first time since June 16-17. Since taking two of three from Atlanta in mid-June, the Orioles are just 5-10.Noesi barely lasted five innings and became the first 11-game loser in baseball and his time in the rotation may be running out. It was the fourth straight start with Noesi giving up at least seven hits and he has not left a game with the lead since May 17 against Cleveland. He has not won since May 6.Jones' homer came on a 2-0 count in the second. According to STATS LLC, it was the first time this season Noesi has given up a hit on a 2-0 pitch. It was Noesi's 20th home run allowed.''He has to be more aggressive,'' Seattle manager Eric Wedge said of Noesi. ''We need him to take that next step to where we know what we're getting from him.''NOTES: Seattle C Jesus Montero left in the fifth inning after taking a foul ball from Andino off the facemask. Montero was down on a knee for several minutes and was wobbly when he first stood up. Wedge said Montero had a mild concussion. ...

(AP Photo/Chris Carlson)MoreANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Angels rallied past the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday night, and the clubhouse felt as if they just absorbed a difficult loss. Most of it had to do with watching a teammate get sent down to the minor leagues after another poor performance.Rookie Garrett Richards surrendered three home runs but Los Angeles scored five times in the fourth and went on to a 9-7 victory. Kendrys Morales had a big two-run single, which got lost in the shuffle after Richards was optioned to Triple-A Salt Lake.Manager Mike Scioscia kept the clubhouse closed for a half-hour. By the time reporters were allowed in, a downcast Richards was still at his locker getting some parting words of encouragement from teammates C.J. Wilson and Albert Pujols, and pitching coach Mike Butcher.''Garrett was struggling with his command, first and foremost,'' Scioscia said. ''He has such a live arm, but you need to command counts and he's having a lot of trouble doing that. So we're going to let Garrett go down and work on a couple of things so that he'll be more polished when he gets his next shot. I think we have a lot of things to mull over the next week, and we'll see how our rotation lines up after the break.''Richards gave up seven runs and 10 hits in 4 1-3 innings, including consecutive first-pitch homers by Mark Reynolds and Ryan Flaherty to open the second and a three-run shot by Matt Wieters in the fourth.''I made a mistake to Reynolds. The pitch to Flaherty was a fastball away, and he just did a good job of squaring it up and putting backspin on the ball. They're an aggressive team,'' Richards said. ''The pitch to Wieters I felt like it was a decent pitch. But he's a strong guy and he was able to lift it a little bit. But I don't think he hit it as well as it looked.''The 24-year-old right-hander has surrendered 20 runs and 28 hits along with eight walks over 15 1-3 innings in three starts since June 17, when he pitched eight innings of four-hit ball in a 2-0 win against Arizona.''I still feel like I'm the same pitcher I was that day,'' Richards said. ''Pitchers are going to go through streaks, just like hitters do. I've got to start throwing strikes more consistently. I'm missing my spots right now, the ball's over the plate and I'm getting hit around a little bit. So I've got to go back to the drawing board.''I'm not discouraged at all. I'm motivated. I know I belong up here. I know what kind of pitcher I am and they know what kind of pitcher I am. So I'm just going to keep doing my thing, keep pitching like I'm pitching, and let them make the decision.''LaTroy Hawkins (2-1), the second of six Angels pitchers, retired both batters he faced after relieving Richards and got credit for the victory.Ernesto Frieri got three outs for his 11th save in 11 chances, keeping his spotless ERA intact in 25 appearances with the Angels and helping them climb within four games of the AL West-leading Texas Rangers.The Orioles slipped 5 1/2 behind the idle New York Yankees in the AL East.Baltimore right-hander Jake Arrieta failed to make it out of the fourth inning for the second straight time after getting staked to a 7-3 lead. The right-hander was charged with six runs, five hits and three walks in 3 2-3 innings. He is 1-7 with a 7.71 ERA in 12 starts since May 2, when he threw a career-high eight innings in a 5-0 victory at the Yankees.Like Richards, Arrieta is in danger of losing his spot in the rotation.''I'm not concerned about that,'' Arrieta said. ''Obviously I've struggled, and tonight was a good example of that. But there's nothing I can really do about it now. The first half of the season didn't go as planned. I've worked as hard as I could to be highly successful here and it didn't go that way. But you can't get too discouraged by it. You just have to keep plugging away and find a way to avoid starts like this.''The Orioles scored in the first, second and fourth, but Arrieta's failure to come up with a shutdown inning on any of those occasions ultimately led to his early exit.''That's the most frustrating part of it - when our guys give me a lead like that and I'm not able to get them back in the dugout quickly,'' Arrieta said. ''We had a 7-3 lead in the fourth, and I know what my job is. I've either got to put up a goose egg or limit them to one run. A four or five-run lead is enough for me to win a game.''Angels standout rookie Mike Trout came up in the fourth representing the tying run after Howie Kendrick's RBI single cut the margin to 7-4. He had to settle for his second sacrifice fly, but Torii Hunter greeted Luis Ayala (2-2) with an RBI single that trimmed the deficit to one. Pujols sent Hunter to third with a single before stealing second, and both runners scored on Morales' hit to left field.Trout, heading to his first All-Star game next week, stole three bases to increase his total to 26 - all of them coming after his recall from Salt Lake on April 28. He manufactured a run in the sixth by stealing second and third, and continued home on catcher Wieters' errant throw past third baseman Wilson Betemit.NOTES: Angels RHP Dan Haren was placed on the 15-day disabled list for the first time in his 10-year career because of stiffness in his lower back. RHP Kevin Jepsen was recalled from Salt Lake. ... Baltimore's Chris Davis was scratched with a right trapezius strain in his upper back, and Flaherty started in RF. ...

Frieri was fifth behind Jonathan Broxton. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Sun: Orioles are ""going hard"" after Zach Greinke ...', ' Dan Connolly of The Sun posted a story this afternoon in which ""an executive with another big-league club"" was cited as saying that the Orioles are ""going hard"" after Zach Greinke. Wait, what? You may have also seen this headline and had a momentary freak-out. You may have freaked out for more than a moment, which is okay, because if there\'s ever going to be anything to freak out about it\'s the idea of the Orioles dealing prospects for a half-season rental of one of the best pitchers in baseball over the past few years. Unfortunately (or fortunately, depending on your point of view) the very next paragraph throws cold water on the whole concept by reminding us that ""talks are preliminary"" and that the Orioles won\'t be the only team calling about Greinke. So some industry source claiming the Orioles are presently the most aggressive suitor isn\'t really worth a hill of beans. There will be a lot of suitors and most probably have better farm systems than the Orioles. Worth noting from Connolly\'s article is that the pitching coach of the Milwaukee Brewers, where Greinke is currently, is none other than Rick Kranitz, who has some familiarity with players like Brian Matusz, Jake Arrieta and Zach Britton. Their stars have been tarnished of late, but may have some value to the Brewers if Kranitz believes he can turn things back around. I still find myself skeptical of this idea, because it seems like one of those things that the media writes about because they need to fill some column inches and it\'s probably never going to matter in the real world.    That the Orioles need starting pitching, none of us can doubt. Certainly, the Orioles don\'t doubt it, since they\'ve demoted Tommy Hunter, Matusz and Arrieta over the past seven days. Whether it\'s worth getting worked up about the Orioles acquiring someone at the top of the market is another story.    Another article written today, this one by MASN\'s Steve Melewski, quotes Dan Duquette as saying, ""The future is always now, when you are trying to win."" On the other hand, Duquette also told Melewski when asked about Dylan Bundy and Manny Machado - two of the top ten prospects in all of baseball by most of the mid-season rankings being published - that ""they look to be long-term solutions for the Orioles."" You can throw just about any other player in the Orioles system at a wall and some of them might stick and a team might say, ""Sure, I\'d like that guy,"" but whether those other names will be enough to beat the offers of other teams, well, I am pretty skeptical of that.    Dan Duquette has been upgrading on the margins throughout his time in Baltimore. One thing you can say about the Orioles rotation is that it\'s been so bad that you don\'t need to plug in a star to upgrade it. A 4.00 ERA innings eater-type - if they could actually manage a 4.00 ERA and eat innings in Baltimore - would still be a heck of a lot better than some of what we\'ve seen recently. Even that said, if you look at the list of starting pitchers in the 3.70-4.30 ERA range, what you see is a lot of guys who probably either aren\'t available or I\'d rather not see on the Orioles at the price being asked. For instance, Matt Garza is being talked about as one of the marquee guys on the market. This year he has a 4.32 ERA - in the National League - while averaging fewer than 6 IP. That\'s not gonna cut the mustard for eating innings, especially since he\'ll be facing better lineups in the AL. Another name running down that list is Bartolo Colon, who\'s managing around a 4.00 ERA in the cavernous O.co Mausoleum Colosseum and averaging just under 6 IP as well. I just don\'t see where it\'d be worth getting into a bidding war to acquire the likes of these guys. Then again, what do I know? One of the pitchers who\'s on that list - not as a trade target, just as a guy in the right range of ERA who\'s eating innings - is Edwin Jackson, who I expected would not be worth the contract he was seeking and argued against the Orioles signing over the offseason. Jackson has a 3.73 ERA this season and is averaging about 6.1 IP/GS. Maybe he would look good in orange after all - although the NL is not the AL East. And as we all know, there was no way it seemed over the offseason that the Orioles would be contending soon enough that it\'d be worth a big expenditure on a guy like Jackson. Indeed, as I was in the process of writing this article, the smoke to these rumors grew a bit more. ESPN\'s Jerry Crasnick posted a couple of tweets indicating he is hearing the same rumors as Connolly, and he specifically mentions Brian Matusz as a potential change-of-scenery trade chip. I still don\'t see it happening, but it would be neither the first time nor the last time that I would be absolutely, completely and totally wrong about something involving the Orioles. My standard advice is to prepare to panic or celebrate as you deem appropriate, but also prepare for absolutely nothing to happen, because nothing is usually what happens.

(AP) -- Miguel Gonzalez wore Nick Adenhart's glove onto the mound at Angel Stadium, honoring the memory of his fellow former Angels minor leaguer on the occasion of his first major league start.The 28-year-old Baltimore rookie then gave a performance that would have made his late friend proud.Gonzalez pitched seven stellar innings for his first career victory, Steve Pearce hit a three-run homer, and the Orioles hung on to beat the Los Angeles Angels 3-2 Friday night.Gonzalez (1-0) yielded three hits and a run while striking out six and outdueling All-Star C.J. Wilson for Baltimore's third victory in four games during its West Coast road swing. Gonzalez's fellow Orioles realized the well-traveled local kid overcame injury and tragedy to reach this night, and they ambushed him with shaving cream and a shower of cold beverages in the locker room.''With the things Miguel has been through and the road he has traveled in his life, I don't think there's any question he deserved this,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.Gonzalez was recuperating from Tommy John surgery in 2009 when Adenhart was killed by a drunk driver just a few hours after the Maryland native made his first start of the season for the Angels. Adenhart had given the glove to Gonzalez when they were both in Angels camp in 2007, dreaming of someday making the big leagues.Gonzalez has kept the glove with him ever since, even taking it on the road in the minors with two organizations. When he finally got a callup with the Orioles and then a spot start - in Anaheim, no less, just a short drive from his home - he knew what to wear to the biggest game of his life.''I thought it was a good time to do it,'' said Gonzalez, emotions swelling behind his eyes. ''I've been taking it with me every time on the road. I used it once in a while. ... I'm with him in my heart, and his family, I'm with them, too.''His own family also was close at hand. Gonzalez, who is from the nearby San Fernando Valley, thrilled the 200 or so family members watching the culmination of his determination.''I'm a fighter, and I've been doing well all around,'' Gonzalez said. ''Family and friends were all there for me. After all the ups and downs I've had, I was just glad to help out the team.''Gonzalez allowed just one runner to reach second base for the Angels, who signed the right-hander as a rookie free agent in December 2004 before losing him to Boston four years later in the Rule 5 draft. Gonzalez sat out two full seasons with a knee problem and his shoulder surgery. The Red Sox released him, but he signed with Baltimore last March.''Guys come and go in the Rule 5 draft, and certainly there's only so many guys you can protect,'' Angels manager Mike Scioscia said. ''He was a guy who actually was injured when Boston drafted him, but he certainly has gotten healthy and taken some steps forward. He pitched a terrific game tonight for those guys.''After Troy Patton escaped an eighth-inning jam, Jim Johnson pitched the ninth for his major league-leading 26th save for Baltimore.Wilson (9-5) allowed just four hits and three walks over seven innings in his final start before his All-Star game appearance, but the Angels lost with the left-hander on the mound for the first time in nine starts since May 17.''We're trying to get the momentum going in these last few games before the All-Star break, and when I'm on the mound, I expect a better result than I gave tonight,'' Wilson said. ''It doesn't really matter why you lose, but any time you give up three runs or a three-run homer, it's not a good game.''Mark Trumbo hit his 50th career homer for the Angels, who have lost three of four while missing chances to gain ground on the slumping Texas Rangers in the AL West. Mike Trout also homered in the eighth for Los Angeles.Gonzalez made his only mistake to Trumbo, who connected in the fourth inning for his 21st homer of the season. The slugger hit his first 50 homers in a club-record 232 games, faster than Tim Salmon's 245.But Pearce's homer into the short left-field porch ruined another solid start for Wilson, who allowed only Adam Jones' single and two walks in the first four innings - and he picked off both of the runners he walked as they attempted to steal.After Wilson Betemit singled and Mark Reynolds walked to open the fifth, Pearce hit just his third homer of the season on a full-count inside pitch. Wilson has allowed just two homers in his last 10 starts - and Pearce hit both of them, also connecting off Wilson in Baltimore on June 26 during the Angels' 7-3 win.After Trout homered against Darren O'Day, Torii Hunter followed with a triple, but Patton got Kendrys Morales on a popup.NOTES: Pearce never hit more than four homers in a season during his previous five years spent with Pittsburgh. ...

Tonight, the Orioles fielded two birdland players - Miguel Gonzalez and Steve Pearce. After cruising through AAA hitters at Norfolk earlier this year with an impressive 10.7 SO/9 rate, Gonzalez made his first start after three impressive relief appearances for the O's. He continued his strong performance by limiting the Angels to one run in seven innings. Mark Trumbo hit a solo home run in the fourth inning for the Angels' only run. Tonight's performance should seal a temporary spot in the rotation for Gonzalez as he struck out 6 hitters and gave up only three hits. Who the hell is this guy? He was signed by the Angels in 2004 at the age of 20 as an amateur free agent. He then spent the next two seasons as a reliever for the Angels before becoming a starter in 2006 at AA Arkanasas. The Angels then released him and he spent the next two years as a double agent for S.H.I.E.L.D. before the Red Sox picked him up in 2010. The Red Sox let him go after two seasons of distinguished mediocrity before Dan Duquette signed him as a free agent this past March. I don't know what happened to Gonzalez between last year and this year, but a light has turned on for him. Whether that light remains on for 2-3 months or the next 4-5 years, I don't know, but he's been a sneaky good pick up. In the 7th inning, Gonzalez ran into a little trouble as he walked the lead off batter promptly leading the pen to get up. But he then induced a fly out from Alberto Callaspo and a double play grounder from Howie Kendrick to finish out his night. Steve Pierce gave Gonzalez the win by hitting a game winning, three run homer in the fifth inning. The inning started with a single by Wilson Betemit and a walk by Mark Reynolds before Pearce hit a Earl Weaver special on a full count off of OC native CJ Wilson. Team Steve is pretty much the definition of a replacement level player. He spent the last five seasons doing a whole lot of nothing with the Pittsburgh Pirates. But tonight his homer drove in all of the O's runs which turned out to be just enough for the win. So Team Steve, please put a bird on the Angels' cutesy give away tonight.   Otherwise, CJ Wilson pitched a strong a game by scattering four hits across seven innings. Wilson never looked dominant but he did a good job of mixing up the speed of his pitches throughout the night. I suspect he relied on a slider and a curve during the early innings before working in his fastball gradually during the second and third times through the line up. Wilson was almost off the hook for the loss as the Angels threatened in the 8th. Mike Trout continued playing Bugs Bunny baseball by blasting a solo wheel home run off of Darren O'Day. O'Day then gave up a triple to Torrii Hunter before Troy Patton came in and retired Kendrys Morales to preserve the lead. In the ninth, Jim Johnson earned his 26th save by inducing a couple of ground ball outs and a fly out. The only thing that kept the O's from earning a textbook Weaver win was the base running mistakes. Wilson picked off both Mark Reynolds and the X-Man in the second and third innings respectively. Tomorrow Jason Hammel takes the bump as the O's try to secure a series tie.     "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

(AP Photo/Jae C. Hong)MoreANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Three days before his third straight All-Star game, Jered Weaver again displayed the form that has made the midsummer classic a regular part of his schedule.The Los Angeles Angels' ace scattered three hits over eight innings Saturday night in a 3-0 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. His glittering performance may have earned Weaver a second straight All-Star start, depending on what AL manager Ron Washington decides.''To be able to start back-to-back All-Star games would be pretty sweet,'' Weaver said. ''It was an honor to start last year, but there are some other candidates throwing the ball real well in the American League. So it's not something I'm getting my hopes up about. Hopefully, I can just get out there and throw an inning. But we'll see what happens.''Weaver (10-1) won his fourth straight start since coming off the disabled list, allowing just one run over 27 2-3 innings during that stretch after missing three weeks with a lower back strain. The right-hander struck out five and walked one while lowering his ERA to a major league-best 1.96.Weaver joined Sandy Koufax (1963-64) as the only pitchers since 1950 with consecutive seasons of double-digit wins and an ERA under 2.00 before the All-Star break. During his seven-year career, the Angels' ace is 59-26 with a 2.84 ERA in 110 starts before the All-Star break. Last season he was 11-4 with a 1.86 ERA in 19 starts before the break.''I had less losses in the first half this year than last year, which is pretty good because it means that I've been able to keep the team in the game and give us a chance to win,'' Weaver said. ''And our offense has been spectacular the last two months, so there's been a lot of help on the team's end to get me to where I'm at.''Weaver improved to 14-2 at home since the start of last season.''Any starting pitcher will tell you that it's more comfortable to pitch at home,'' he said. ''You get that white uniform on and you know that the home crowd's going to be supporting and be behind you. That's a very comfortable feeling. This is a pitcher's park, there's no question about that, so it's easier to let some pitches go instead of trying to be too fine.''A good example of how Angel Stadium plays for Weaver was demonstrated by Orioles All-Star catcher Matt Wieters, who flied out to the warning track in the fourth and seventh innings.''They've got a lot of guys in their lineup that can hurt you,'' Weaver said. ''Obviously, I got away with some pitches that they hit to the warning track, and that misty air kind of knocked them down.''Scott Downs pitched a perfect ninth for his eighth save in eight attempts.Jason Hammel (8-5) gave up three runs, six hits and four walks over 6 2-3 innings and struck out four. He also hooked up against Weaver on June 26 at Baltimore, and was charged with eight runs in 3 1-3 innings that night in a 13-1 loss after bringing a 19-inning scoreless streak into the game.''I made a lot of adjustments from that game. I pitched inside a lot more and it was very effective against a team that makes contact as much as they do,'' Hammel said. ''They were diving out and getting balls on the outer half the last time, so anything that I was able to change from that outing to this one was definitely good.''Mark Trumbo led off the Angels' fourth with a single and legged it to second after left fielder Xavier Avery misplayed the ball for the Orioles' major league-worst 75th error. Trumbo got to third after tagging up on Alberto Callaspo's flyout to the warning track in center, and Kendrick singled sharply to the right of second base with the infield playing in.Angels Gold Glove right fielder Torii Hunter helped choke off an Orioles threat in the seventh when he played the carom perfectly off the 18-foot wall on a single by slugger Jim Thome and threw out the 41-year-old designated hitter at second base with the Angels still leading 1-0.''He pushed the envelope there,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Torii is a good thrower and Jimmy understands the situation.''The Halos tacked on two more runs in the bottom half with a two-out RBI double by Hunter and an RBI single by Kendrys Morales. But it was the speed of rookie Mike Trout that kept the inning going for Hunter, as the 20-year-old rookie beat the relay to first base on a potential inning-ending double-play grounder to second baseman Robert Andino.''He's a catalyst for that team, and we've seen it since he's come up. They've been a completely different team,'' Hammel said. ''I made a good pitch there and he hit it into the ground, but with his speed he was able to keep the inning alive.''NOTES: Orioles 1B Joe Mahoney was 0 for 3 in his major league debut, two days after his contract was purchased from Norfolk. He was a sixth-round draft pick in 2007 out of the University of Richmond. ... Weaver will be the fourth pitcher in Angels history to represent them in three consecutive All-Star games. The others were LHP Mark Langston (1991-93), LHP Frank Tanana (1976-78) and RHP Ken McBride (1961-1963).

That was pretty much the case as Jered Weaver looked great against a hapless O's lineup and Jason Hammel was solid, but struggled late. The story of the game however was the Angels pitching staff which left no doubts as they easily plowed through the Oriole lineup. You can't really get mad at the Orioles though because Weaver is such a great pitcher, but it is frustrating to watch a night like this. Chris Davis reached in the first with two outs, thanks to a ball that went right through the legs of Howie Kendrick who was playing the shift. Adam Jones would strike out though with Davis at second as he swung at a 0-2 fastball that was over his shoulders. With two outs in the second, Wilson Betemit roped one down the right field line, it looked like he might be thrown out at second, but Torii Hunter came up and threw the ball to Jared Weaver who was crouched, minding his own business by the mound. In his very first Major League at bat Joe Mahoney made Weaver throw some pitches but flew out to right field to end the inning. After this the Orioles would have almost no chances to score. Hammel started off with a great first that ended with making Albert Pujols look foolish.    In the second, Hammel continued to pitch well. He made Mark Trumbo look silly on an up and in fastball. But with two outs he walked Alberto Callaspo. He then hit Howie Kendrick to put two on with two outs. He got out by getting a one pitch flyout from Erick Aybar.    Dino started off the third by taking the count full and then knocking a single right back up the middle, great result to a great at bat. Avery struck out and then Andino got caught stealing as the Angels called a pitchout, the throw from Wilson was not a good one, but it beat Andino, barely. Hardy ended the inning by striking out. Bobby Wilson started the bottom of the third with a single to bring up Mike Trout. Hammel walked Trout on 4 pitches, putting himself in serious trouble. He fought back and got Hunter to strike out. He got Pujols to fly out to deep left, Wilson tagged up from second and Avery made the smart play and threw in to second base. Kendry Morales bounced out to second and Hammel escaped the jam.    Trumbo led off the fourth with a single past Wilson Betemit and Xavier Avery couldn't come up with the ball cleanly allowing Trumbo to reach second to lead off the inning. Callaspo drove one to center allowing Trumbo to tag up and reach third base. Kendrick then knocked a single up the middle past the drawn in infield, putting the Angels on top 1-0. Aybar grounded into a forceout, Wilson then send one past a diving Betemit and since no one was covering third, Aybar went to third and got in ahead of a poor throw by Avery. Trout then blooped out to Andino in shallow right to end the inning. In the 7th Thome drilled one of the wall in right which he tried to stretch into a double and he got thrown out by Hunter who made a great play on the ball. Thome probably should have stayed at first since he isn't exactly a young, nimble, speedster. That would be the last baserunner for the Orioles. In the bottom of the 7th Hammel walked Wilson with one out, Trout grounded into a force out, then Hunter doubled into the right field corner allowing Trout to score the second run.Albert  Pujols was then walked intentionally and  Morales drove a base hit to right making it 3-0. That would spell the end of the night for Hammel. Pedro Strop got the final out, but not before the Angels grabbed a 3-0 lead off of Hammel, more than enough for a win. The O's would roll over 1,2,3 in the 8th against Weaver.  Dana Eveland came in for a scoreless 1,2,3, 8th inning thanks in part to a nice play made by Wilson Betemit on a bunt attempt. In the bottom of the ninth Scott Downs came in to close it out for the Angels. Steve Pearce started out by flying out to right. Hardy took the count to 3-1 before grounding out sharply to third and Davis struck out and the O's lost with a whimper. Tomorrow afternoon the O's will try to score a run and even the series up before heading into the All Star Break.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
07/09/2012,"[('Will Orioles fortify rotation in second half? - yahoo.com', ""If the season were to end at the All-Star break, the Baltimore Orioles would be a playoff team.  Given that scenario in March, Orioles fans would have been ecstatic.  Riding a string of 14 straight losing seasons and with a bevy of questions heading into Opening Day, the expectations weren't high for the 2012 Orioles.  The three weeks following the All-Star break will be crucial for the Orioles. Namely: What will they do, and who can they acquire?  Recent reports suggest the team has looked into acquiring starting pitching help -- particularly Brewers righty Zach Greinke and Astros lefty Wandy Rodriguez.  The Orioles have two of the most attractive trade chips in all of baseball: shortstop Manny Machado and the game's top prospect, righty Dylan Bundy. But the club is set against dealing either of its two phenoms.  Instead, the Orioles could dangle some of their young pitching talent that has thus far defined the shortcomings of the 2012 squad: lefty Brian Matusz or righty Jake Arrieta.  Consistency in the rotation and defense at third base are the two primary concerns for the club moving forward.  Whether or not the second half of 2012 can live up to the first half, and no matter if the club can break its streak of losing seasons, the Orioles have shown a strong core of players yet to reach their primes. Most important, the Orioles have shown a tenacity unseen in Baltimore during the last decade.  A playoff shot remains a realistic possibility -- but would only come to fruition if the rotation and infield defense can improve. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('A Magical Baseball Moment - Camden Chat', ' There is no magic in baseball. That said, its best moments are the ones that find a way to be magical anyway. Sometimes you get to witness one of those magic moments as it\'s happening and you know that it\'s magic. The fact that Cal Ripken Jr. hit a home run in both consecutive games 2,130 and 2,131 has a perfectly rational explanation. That doesn\'t change the fact that for two nights, the baseball gods smiled down upon him and upon Baltimore. If you watched those games, you were watching magic and you knew it at the time. Other times, there is magic happening and you only find out it was magic later. This can be something as simple as discovering a player has changed shoes on the game where he goes 4-5 with two home runs. It can also be something much more full of emotion, and thus, powerful. Friday night, Orioles pitcher Miguel Gonzalez had one of those magical games, though it was only afterwards that we found out just how magical. The story of Gonzalez using the glove given to him by his former teammate, the late Nick Adenhart, from their days together in the Angels system, as he pitched his way to his first major league win, is one of those magical baseball moments. Nobody in the wide world knew about this until after the game was over. Had Gonzalez not pitched very well - and this would have surprised no one, considering he is 28 years old and was signed by the Orioles out of the Mexican League - then maybe the tidbit would have gotten a passing mention, an ""Oh, how nice."" Instead, there was not a story that failed to mention it once the reporters covering the game were aware of it. And why shouldn\'t they write about it? If nothing else, that was a very interesting and human moment to the game. Adenhart pitched in the same stadium, so of course Gonzalez would want to honor him as he made his starting debut. Was there any magic in that glove that allowed Gonzalez to go seven innings while only surrendering one run on a home run by Mark Trumbo? Of course not! That doesn\'t mean it wasn\'t magic.    The impulse is always there to measure and make sense out of everything. As the famous astronomer Galileo once said, ""Measure what can be measured, and make measurable what cannot be measured."" This is the same thing that drives baseball\'s advanced statistical community. To be sure, you can do all of that stuff for any given baseball moment. For Gonzalez on Friday night, you could look at the Pitch F/x and know the release point, movement, velocity and location of each and every pitch he threw. With video replay, you could break down the exact pitch sequence for each of the six strikeouts he recorded. You could know all of these things, and all of them are good things to know.    Yet if you take all of those things and assume that you know everything, you would be missing something. One of the many great utterances of player-manager-philosopher Yogi Berra is this: ""Ninety percent of baseball is half-mental."" This is probably true, and these mental sorts of things also probably will show up in a stat sheet, eventually, even in the case of Gonzalez\'s great start. A player who\'s channeling emotions into some productive adrenaline will probably end up with that little bit of extra zip on his fastball, that little bit more sensory awareness, reaction time, or whatever.    You miss out on a lot of fun when you try to pick everything out like that, though. I think so, anyway. I don\'t want to tell anybody else what to enjoy about baseball, but I have more fun when I get to enjoy a magical moment. Sometimes - as long as it\'s sparingly - it\'s more fun to toss aside rationality and logic and embrace something as inexplicable. Miguel Gonzalez and his random awesome start in Los Angeles are the perfect fit for what is magic in and about baseball. Maybe he will never have another great start ever again in his career - though O\'s fans certainly hope he will. Maybe it will turn out that was just the tip of the iceberg, that, much like his current teammate Jason Hammel, he\'s figured something out about pitching in his late 20s and the Orioles were just the right team to realize it and give him a chance at the right time. Either way, reports about the glove are that Gonzalez is not going to use it any more. He had been carrying it around but not using it since Adenhart\'s death and decided that his first start being against the Angels was the time to use it. He wants to preserve it to preserve a memory of a friend, and that is a kind and good thing to do. So if, hypothetically, there was something magic about the glove, Gonzalez won\'t benefit from it any more. He is on his own now, and if he continues on to some level of success then he will have found that the power was inside of him all along - which, if you think about it, is pretty magical, too.

07/10/2012,"[('Baltimore Orioles: Gameday experience done right in MLB', 'Adam Jones, Matt Wieters, and Jim Johnson will represent the Orioles in tonight\xe2\x80\x99s MLB all-star game in Kansas City. Hopefully we\xe2\x80\x99ll all be tuning in on FOX this evening, and with the way that the first half unfolded perhaps Oriole fans will have a bit more of a rooting interest given that if the season ended today the Birds would be in the playoffs. (Keep in mind that the league that wins the all-star game gets home field advantage in the world series.) However outside of Kansas City, there\xe2\x80\x99s very little baseball news of which to report right now\xe2\x80\xa6so I\xe2\x80\x99m trying to get inventive in my topics.It came to my attention last week that the NFL is easing it\xe2\x80\x99s blackout rules for the upcoming 2012 season. \xc2\xa0Teams will now only need to sell 85% of the general admission ticket inventory in their stadium in order for that week\xe2\x80\x99s game to be televised in the home market. In the mid-Atlantic region we have two NFL teams (the Ravens and the Washington Redskins), neither of which has ever been affected by the blackout rules because they sell out every game. However that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case in places such as Jacksonville, Tampa, and Buffalo, who sometimes struggle to sell out games. (For what it\xe2\x80\x99s worth, Jacksonville might struggle to get blackouts lifted with the 85% rule.)\xc2\xa0In reading about this, I came across this piece from a Pittsburgh Steeler fan site (I know that\xe2\x80\x99s not the most popular team in Baltimore but I felt this was well written and it gets the point across).While wins and losses are certainly important to attendance in any sport, that article seems to indicate that the gameday experience is now a bit more important. Being a Washington Redskins season ticket holder and having attended a few Ravens games as well, I\xe2\x80\x99d tend to believe that the Ravens have one of the best gameday experiences in the NFL. The Redskins\xe2\x80\xa6not so much (but I do believe it\xe2\x80\x99s getting better and I think that reports of how horrible it is are a bit overblown). However the article also mentions that it isn\xe2\x80\x99t just the actual stadium experience about which people seem to care; it\xe2\x80\x99s getting to and from the game as well. So why is this relevant to baseball and to the Orioles?My point here is not to put MLB into a match of family feud with the NFL. I love the NFL, and I love football; I have no urge to beat it down. However I do feel that the \xe2\x80\x9cgameday experience\xe2\x80\x9d is something that baseball has always done right. In fairness, there\xe2\x80\x99s probably a more relaxed atmosphere at baseball games first off because they occur largely during summertime. Secondly each city gets ten football games a year (counting preseason), not including potential playoff games. That means that when the games roll around people tend to treat them more like \xe2\x80\x9cevents\xe2\x80\x9d than anything else. That\xe2\x80\x99s possibly one of the reasons why we see so many drunks getting out of control at games.With regard to getting to the games, neither Orioles or Ravens fans should complain. Camden Yards/M & T Bank Stadium are very easily accessible by roads or light rail, as is Nationals Park. If you read the article I linked you\xe2\x80\x99ll see a detailed description of the hoops the author had to jump through to get to a Minnesota Vikings game. In this age where products are measured by every degree imaginable, that does make a difference. The transportation issues obviously vary city-by-city, and in fact the teams themselves might not have a lot of control over that. (DC is a perfect example; people blame owner Daniel Snyder for the traffic problems from the moment they leave home until they get back from the games.) Yet they\xe2\x80\x99re still being held accountable for them in the sense that attendance is going down.If the city\xe2\x80\x99s transportation system is lackluster odds are it\xe2\x80\x99s going to affect the baseball team as well. However again keep in mind that baseball\xe2\x80\x99s a summer game so people are generally a little more laid back. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing that could affect both leagues: Direct TV. With the Extra Innings or Sunday Ticket packages, people can literally watch every game in the league on any given day/week. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have Extra Innings, you can go to most local watering holes and see every game because most bars have that package. Even if you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to watch every game, the TV viewing experience has gotten so much better over the years. I know people that have theater-style viewing setups in their homes; why would they want to buy a ticket to a game when they can watch it like that?I would submit that wins and losses still mean more to attendance than anything else in all sports. Look at the Washington Capitals of the NHL as an example. However again, baseball games have always been more fan-friendly. From my perch I observed Jim Thome signing autographs for fans last week in his first game as an Oriole at Camden Yards. Many players do that; how often do NFL players sign autographs like that for people in the stands? Baseball is also legendary for it\xe2\x80\x99s giveaways. This coming Sunday is hat day at Camden Yards, and the first 20K fans will get a free cap. I remember going to Redskin games at RFK Stadium as a kid and sometimes they\xe2\x80\x99d have giveaways, but I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that so much at NFL games anymore. Plus baseball has the built-in free souvenir of game-used balls going into the stands. My point is not to knock the NFL, because as I said I love football. However I do feel that baseball does a better job all-around when it comes to the overall \xe2\x80\x9cgameday experience.\xe2\x80\x9d If you\xe2\x80\x99re asking would I ever give up my own tickets for any of the above-mentioned things\xe2\x80\xa6NO!Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('If the Season Ended Today - Camden Chat, a Baltimore ...', ' The following is NOT a true statement: If the season ended today, the Baltimore Orioles would be in the playoffs. This is a true statement:On August 11, 1994, the Montreal Expos lost to the Pittsburgh Pirates four to nothing. It gave Montreal a 74-40 record, which was the best in baseball. The season ended that day, and the Expos most certainly did not go to the playoffs. The 1994 postseason was cancelled along with the remaining 48 regular season games when the players union went on strike. Right now, the Orioles (45-40) occupy the second spot in the American League Wild Card standings over, in order, Tampa Bay, Cleveland, Detroit, Boston, Toronto, and Oakland. But there\'s no scenario where that accurately translates to ""if the season ended today, the O\'s would be in the playoffs"", because that would forget the pressing matter of the entire second half of the season. There is no prize for being the second best Wild Card team after 85 games. You might think that I\'m making a petty argument about semantics. What I see when I see ""If the season ended today, the Orioles would be a playoff team!"" is someone applying spin and trying to get the facts of the matter to work for them. As a sabrmetrics guy, I\'ve been told more than a few times over the years banal things like ""There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics"". I\'ve always taken that type of thing to mean that people generally think the stats world is full of spin and that you can find a stat to support any argument you want to make on any subject. There\'s a big kernel of truth there, but that doesn\'t just apply to statistics or sabrmetrics. People are spinning facts at you all the time.    The Orioles\' fans, specifically, are done a disservice here. The Orioles\' position in the wild card hunt - and it seems extraordinarily unlikely that Baltimore is able to get back into the divisional race, sitting seven games behind the Yankees - is hardly solid. Of the six teams I mentioned as being in the race, the teams farthest behind (Toronto, Boston, and Oakland) are all only three games back in the loss column, a difference that can be made up in one bad weekend. Tampa Bay and Cleveland are only one game back. None of these teams have a worse run differential than Baltimore. Only Oakland has scored fewer runs per game, and only Toronto and Cleveland have given up more runs per game.The Orioles have no true leadoff hitter, only two starting pitchers, several players in non-optimized defensive placements, and a harsher schedule than any other team. The odds are stacked against them. It doesn\'t take away from their tremendous first half, which has been as fun and surprising as baseball should be. But I keep coming back to something Buck Showalter said this past spring training, which was that the season is too long for there to be any Cinderellas. The cream always rises to the top. The uncomfortable truth is that the Orioles got here in a pumpkin carriage. They aren\'t good enough for the playoffs. They need to outlast a clock that still has 3 months to go.

The Orioles have had their share of great moments in the mid-summer classic. Six times an Orioles player has been named the game\xe2\x80\x99s MVP. Can you name the 5 players who\xe2\x80\x99ve won the award 6 times? Here are my 5 greatest Oriole all-star memories. 5. This is actually a pre-game memory. With his streak at 2,239 Cal Ripken took a mighty blow at the 1996 all-star game in Philadelphia. The American League team picture nearly did in the Iron Man. While leaving the platform erected in center field Chicago pitcher Roberto Hernandez stumbled, in an effort to regain his balance he snapped out his left-arm connecting squarely on the bridge of Cal\xe2\x80\x99s nose. The nose was bloodied and broken, Cal was taken to the trainers room. Speculation started, could this be a streak ending injury? Of course not! The nose was popped back into place and Cal played on. 4. Frank Robinson was the MVP of the 1971 All-Star game in Detroit. This was one of the most entertaining games in All-Star history. The American League win was rare (they went 1-19 during a 20 game stretch in this period). All the runs in this 6-4 game came on home runs by future Hall of Famers. Frank\xe2\x80\x99s 2-run shot game the AL a 4-3 lead. He became the first player to hit All-Star homers for both leagues. Reggie Jackson hit maybe the longest in All-Star history, estimated at 520 feet, it hit the light standard on the right field roof. Aaron, Bench, Killebrew and Clemente who was playing in his final All-Star game all went deep. 3. This one might get overlooked by a lot of people, maybe because I was there I won\xe2\x80\x99t forget it. The 1980 All-Star game at Dodger Stadium featured a terrific outing by Steve Stone who was living the dream in the midst of a Cy Young season. American League manager Earl Weaver gave Stone the start and he didn\xe2\x80\x99t let Earl down. Stone pitched 3 perfect innings taming a NL roster that included Pete Rose, Steve Garvey, Dave Parker, Mike Schmidt, Dale Murphy and Dave Winfield. Nine up nine down with 3 K\xe2\x80\x99s, Stone was perfect his teammates were not. National league won the game 4-2. 2. The \xe2\x80\x9991 game in Toronto was pretty much the Cal Ripken Invitational. He owned SkyDome. He hit the break hitting .348 with 18 homers and 54 RBI\xe2\x80\x99s. And then he got hot! He won the HR Derby starting with 7 homers on 7 swings. He hit 12 homers with 22 swings, a HR Derby record at the time. The next day he took former teammate Dennis Martinez deep to center for a 3-run shot. When the smoke cleared Cal was the first to ever win the HR Derby and All-Star game MVP in the same season. He finished the season with 211 hits and 34 homers and was named MVP for the 2nd time in his career. 1. His .240 batting average didn\xe2\x80\x99t get him there, it was more of a life-time achievement award that sent Cal to Seattle for his final all-star game in the summer of 2001. The fans voted him in at 3rd base but Alex Rodriguez pulled a last minute switch and sent a reluctant Cal to shortstop. The players and fans loved it, a blast from the past! And then it happened, the 40 year old who had recently announced this would be his final season gave the baseball world one more lasting memory. On his first at bat he was greeted with a rousing standing ovation, with the Safeco crowd still on their feet POW!!! He took a Chan Ho Park pitch over the wall in left, The Iron Man went out with a bang, with opposing National League All-Stars cheering and a sell out crowd going crazy Cal floated around the bases and was mobbed by admiring teammates at the plate.

Fact is, in recent years it has sometimes seemed a stretch finding even one Oriole worthy of sharing a bench with the game\'s best players (Ty Wigginton, anyone?). That the O\'s had three representatives in Kansas City this week suggests that there is something different about the team this year. var adSkipCounter = 0; The Orioles begin the second half of their season Friday night in a position that few would have predicted on Opening Day: five games over .500 and in second place in the American League East. If the season were to end right now, the Orioles would qualify for a one-game wild card playoff under baseball\'s new postseason rules.How they got to this point is a bit mysterious. The Orioles are the worst-fielding team in baseball and, despite an early burst of home run prowess, one of the lightest-hitting. Their starting pitching has been wildly inconsistent. Only the bullpen \xe2\x80\x94 baseball\'s best, anchored by Mr. Johnson, who leads the major leagues in saves \xe2\x80\x94 has been reliable on a near-daily basis. Injuries to almost all the outfielders on the roster forced a head-spinning procession of call-ups from the minors. And yet, somehow, here we are.Orioles fans, hardened by 14 consecutive losing seasons, are not about to get carried away with optimism. They have seen too many late-season implosions, perhaps most notably in 2005, when after spending 62 days in first place the team tumbled into a disappointing fourth-place finish. When your heart has been broken so often, it\'s not so easy to trust again.And yet ... there is something different in the air, and on the airwaves. Listen to sports radio in this town, and you\'ll hear things that would seem unimaginable in an ordinary year: Should the Orioles spend big on a potentially game-changing ace pitcher before the trade deadline? Should they consider accelerating the progress toward the majors of young Dylan Bundy, perhaps the best minor league pitching prospect in all of baseball? These are questions that are asked by a team and its fans when success \xe2\x80\x94 even a pennant chase \xe2\x80\x94 is a realistic possibility. They are questions they have not been part of the midseason conversation about the Orioles in the Baltimore area\'s bars and basements for many years.There\'s a sense of fun and potential with these Orioles. So many extra-inning, come-from-behind victories. So many stirring performances from unlikely candidates \xe2\x80\x94 ex-Pirate Steve Pearce driving in five runs in a game against his former team, rookie Miguel Gonzalez allowing only three hits in his first major league start. Attendance is up at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which after 20 years is still widely hailed as the best place in the majors to take in a game.There\'s also been frustration aplenty: too many balls booted on routine plays; second-baseman Brian Roberts back on the disabled list after missing more than a year with a concussion; the team\'s best batters in a group slump for most of June; young pitchers Jake Arrieta and Brian Matusz still failing to live up to the hype that has surrounded them the last several years.Will the team break Baltimore\'s heart again? Or will Manager Buck Showalter, who found ways to turn losing teams into winners in New York, Texas and Arizona, work his magic one more time? As Orioles radio broadcaster Joe Angel likes to say, ""You never know."" We don\'t, but we intend to have fun finding out.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

The Rockies have gone 9-12 since.

In another, the left-handed starters Francis, Friedrich and Pomeranz allowed just one run in 17 innings for an earned run average of 0.53.

Other worshipers jubilantly raised their arms and swayed and jumped in the aisles. A band played onstage and a woman waved a fabric flag like a rhythmic gymnast.Thin and blond and boyish at 29 \xe2\x80\x94 flight attendants still asked his age when he sat in an exit row \xe2\x80\x94 Hall wore jeans and a blue shirt labeled with the shoe company that sponsored his running. At the 2011 Boston Marathon, he ran a personal best of 2 hours 4 minutes 58 seconds. No other American has run faster.The Boston course is not certified for record purposes because of its drop in elevation and its layout. Still, of the 29 fastest marathon performances in 2011, Hall\xe2\x80\x99s was the only one by a runner from a country other than Kenya or Ethiopia. His next marathon will come Aug. 12 at the London Olympics. On a Sunday in March, Hall firmly believed he could challenge the East Africans for a gold medal.\xe2\x80\x9cLight a fire in me for the whole world to see,\xe2\x80\x9d he sang.The Bible downloaded on his iPhone, Hall read along with Psalm 68: \xe2\x80\x9cLet God arise and his enemies be scattered.\xe2\x80\x9d He took notes as Bill Johnson, the pastor, casually hip in a sports coat and jeans, spoke to hundreds of worshipers about risk-taking, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cIf you live cautiously, all your friends will call you wise, but you won\xe2\x80\x99t move mountains.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      The sermon seemed particularly resonant with Hall, a Stanford graduate with a degree in sociology, a surfer-dude mien and an approach to running that is experimental and unorthodox. He has pushed the boundaries of conventional training, seeking to confront the dominant East Africans and the unforgiving way that the fastest marathons have become something like 26.2-mile sprints.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  He coaches himself, running alone instead of with an elite training group here in Northern California, two hours above Sacramento, where the flat land of the Central Valley begins to buck and heave like a rodeo bull.For the Olympic marathon trials in January in Houston, Hall trained entirely at sea level, contravening a widely held belief that altitude training is necessary to increase oxygen-carrying capacity and enhance performance. Although he has incorporated some altitude training for the Olympics, Hall has headed to the highlands of Flagstaff, Ariz., for weeks, not months, at a time. He runs 100 miles a week instead of the typical 120, taking one day off each seven days. Every seven weeks, he runs once a day instead of twice, the standard regimen.Hall has yet to win a major marathon. He finished 10th at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. After taking fourth at Boston in the spring of 2011, he finished fifth at the Chicago Marathon last fall. His preparation for the London Games has been complicated by foot problems, disappointing tuneup races and an acknowledgment that his initial training strategy \xe2\x80\x94 to try to shatter the world record \xe2\x80\x94 did not work. But Hall remains flexible, adaptable. He has four weeks until the Olympic marathon to refine a new approach begun over the past month.

The marathon is so isolating in its training, so impossibly fast at the elite level, so restricting to two performances a year for most top runners, that many athletes seek a purpose larger than themselves, something to believe in more than the numbing miles of roadwork. For some, it is their families or an escape from poverty. For others, it is their religion.

Freestyling, he called it. Korir joined in.\xe2\x80\x9cCome Lord Jesus, come,\xe2\x80\x9d the two runners sang as they ran. \xe2\x80\x9cCome Holy Spirit, come.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter finishing second at the 2011 United States half-marathon championships, Hall went to drug testing, a standard procedure. Asked on a form to list his coach, he wrote: God.

It promotes a direct, personal relationship with an unconditionally loving God and what it calls supernatural signs and wonders. These include speaking in tongues, prophecy, healings and miracles that are said by church officials to include the curing of cancer, regeneration of limbs, mending of broken bones and raising the dead.After the Sunday service in March, some worshipers came forward for healing ministry. Prayer teams circled them. Hands were laid on the spiritually and physically ailing. A few collapsed in apparent rapture in the presence of what they believed to be the Holy Spirit.

Hall donates prize money from his races to a nonprofit organization founded by himself and his wife, Sara, the national cross-country champion.

The Halls have financed running programs in the United States to help mentor disadvantaged youth and homeless adults. They have also worked with Korir to build a hospital in Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s Rift Valley.As part of the so-called renewalist evangelical Christian movement, Bethel Church subscribes to a relationship with God that is not distant but intimate. Through prayer, charismatic evangelicals train their minds to converse with God, not unlike athletes who train their bodies to run marathons. They speak to God and believe that he speaks to them in return.

His thoughts become your thoughts.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At Bethel Church, God\xe2\x80\x99s presence is felt in a number of ways, including what is said to be the appearance of feathers from angels\xe2\x80\x99 wings and the manifestation of what is called a \xe2\x80\x9cglory cloud.\xe2\x80\x9dHall said he and his wife had experienced a glory cloud on New Year\xe2\x80\x99s night, likening the phenomenon to fireflies or the flashing of tiny fireworks. Others say it resembles gold dust. He had seen a YouTube version of the glory cloud and was somewhat skeptical, believing that it might be simply a cascade of dust from the ceiling of the church. His skepticism faded when he saw for himself.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like I\xe2\x80\x99ve experienced God in a lot of ways, but I\xe2\x80\x99ve never seen a sign like that in such a tangible way,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cI was like so sure it was God, that it was him doing it, because there was no explanation. I almost feel like we\xe2\x80\x99re kids and he\xe2\x80\x99s our dad and he\xe2\x80\x99s kind of like having fun with us.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It is while running or thinking of running, Hall said, that he feels most conversant with and dependent on God. And it is through this professional excellence that Hall believes he is best able to show God to the world, to display his goodness and his love.Joe Bottom, who won a silver medal in swimming at the 1976 Montreal Games and attends Bethel Church, compared Hall\xe2\x80\x99s Olympic pursuit to that of Eric Liddell, a Christian runner from Scotland who won the 400 meters at the 1924 Paris Games. Liddell\xe2\x80\x99s story was featured in the movie \xe2\x80\x9cChariots of Fire.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In the movie, Liddell is portrayed as saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI feel God made me for a purpose, but he also made me fast. And when I run, I feel his pleasure.\xe2\x80\x9dBottom said in an e-mail: \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s fulfilling, even exhilarating, to feel God\xe2\x80\x99s pleasure in our willingness to pursue and occasionally fulfill the dreams He puts in our hearts and the purposes He built into us. Cooperating with that purpose and those dreams is the greatest fulfillment that one could experience.\xe2\x80\x9dHall said that God spoke to him regularly, giving him training plans, even a race strategy for the London Olympics. He does not hear a voice; rather, he will pray or scroll through workouts in his head and a heightened thought will give him a sense of peace, grace, empowerment. Or a passage from the Bible will seem particularly relevant and urgent. Hall is still learning to distinguish his own thoughts from what he believes are God\xe2\x80\x99s words to him. And sometimes, he has done workouts that in retrospect seem unwise \xe2\x80\x94 a thigh-shredding hill run in Flagstaff, a bicycle time trial a week after the Boston Marathon.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But Hall has also found biblical reinforcement for his training. He takes one day off a week, just as God rested on the seventh day. Every seven weeks, for restoration he runs only once a day instead of twice, an allusion to Exodus 23:11 and the admonition that farmers should leave their fields fallow every seventh year.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  At night, he rubs his legs with anointing oil, another reference to Exodus and the belief that the human body is the temple of the Holy Spirit. Hall bought \xe2\x80\x94 but did not immediately use \xe2\x80\x94 a weighted vest for uphill running, an idea gleaned from Judges 16:3 and Samson hoisting the doors of the city gate of Gaza on his shoulders and carrying them to the top of the hill facing Hebron.In spacing three days between his most arduous workouts, Hall refers to the Holy Trinity and the time that Jesus spent in the tomb; for him, this period represents resurrection, completeness, new life.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThe Bible is not going to tell you how to be a good runner, just like it\xe2\x80\x99s not going to tell you how to build a computer,\xe2\x80\x9d Sara Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t think Ryan is looking at the Bible for a formula, necessarily. There are certain things that God highlights for him that he applies to his training. The majority is what he hears from God.\xe2\x80\x9dSome elite runners seem taken aback by Hall\xe2\x80\x99s faith-based training.\xe2\x80\x9cSo he really thinks God is saying, \xe2\x80\x98Run 10 times 1,200 meters today,\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98Take tomorrow off\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d said Dathan Ritzenhein, who finished ninth in the marathon at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, one spot ahead of his countryman Hall. \xe2\x80\x9cWow.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Hall\xe2\x80\x99s belief in a direct conversation with God was not a fringe occurrence, said T. M. Luhrmann, a Stanford anthropologist who spent a decade researching charismatic evangelicals and wrote a recent, critically acclaimed book, \xe2\x80\x9cWhen God Talks Back.\xe2\x80\x9d Polls have shown that about a quarter of Americans have reported a direct revelation from God or have experienced a voice or a vision through prayer.\xe2\x80\x9cJust the way a well-parented child will carry with them the soothing voice of their mother and father, these folks are really trying to build God as that kind of personal relationship,\xe2\x80\x9d Luhrmann said in an interview. \xe2\x80\x9cIt really does give an emotional buffer to people. It seems people are able to carry with them a sense of comforting reassurance and a sense of inspiration. So it\xe2\x80\x99s not so alien as it seems.\xe2\x80\x9d A Runner\xe2\x80\x99s InspirationOn Aug. 24, 2008, Hall reached the starting line of the Olympic marathon in Beijing, expecting, along with many others, that pollution, heat and humidity would slow the race. A moderate time of 2:09 might win the gold medal, he thought. The temperature at the start was 70 degrees, with 72 percent humidity. Through the race, the temperature rose to 84 degrees. Anything above 55 was considered less than ideal for a marathon.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Still, Hall had anticipated this moment since he was a short, skinny eighth grader in Big Bear Lake, Calif. At the time, baseball was his passion. He wanted to emulate his father, Mickey, who was a pitcher at Pepperdine and was drafted by, but never signed with, the Baltimore Orioles. His father ran, too, as a triathlete. Ryan had loped through a mile in physical education class, but he dreamed of a career in baseball spikes, not racing flats.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mickey Hall said, \xe2\x80\x9cEvery time Ryan went for a run, he\xe2\x80\x99d come back and say, \xe2\x80\x98I\xe2\x80\x99m not a runner.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dThen, as Ryan rode with his teammates to a basketball game one day, Hall experienced what he described as a vision from God, urging him to run around the lake at Big Bear. The family was deeply religious, belonging to a Pentecostal church. The next weekend, wearing basketball shoes, Ryan and his father covered 15 miles. His father tried to dissuade him, but Ryan persisted.

Ryan remembers soaking his legs in the cold water of the lake. When he got home, he collapsed on the couch, exhausted but changed. Soon, Hall gave up other sports. He was now a runner. He went on to win multiple California high school championships, and an N.C.A.A. title at 5,000 meters at Stanford.

But he understood, \xe2\x80\x9cO.K., I\xe2\x80\x99m going to run in the Olympics one day.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  That day had come in Beijing. Hall was considered a medal candidate. But he felt sluggish and when the gun sounded, his race plan crumbled. Sammy Wanjiru of Kenya had an entirely different, unanticipated strategy. He went out at a searing pace. This was a marathon, but it felt like a 10k race.

He was running fast and yet drifting so far back. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s going on?\xe2\x80\x9d he wondered. He felt dazed, hoping the lead pack would come back to him. It did not. Hall grew discouraged and quit checking his splits. A helicopter providing a television feed of the leaders kept moving farther down the road.Dejected, Hall finished 10th in 2:12:33. He was unable to watch a replay of the race for three years. Emotionally scarring, he called it. At the dining hall in the athletes\xe2\x80\x99 village, Hall sought consolation by stuffing himself with cookies and other junk food. He saw the celebrative Wanjiru walking out with a handful of fruit.

He found himself perhaps 50 feet away from the medal podium as Wanjiru had gold placed around his neck, Jaouad Gharib of Morocco received the silver, and Tsegaye Kebede of Ethiopia was awarded the bronze.\xe2\x80\x9cMan, I\xe2\x80\x99m going to get myself there in four years,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall told himself.It would not be easy. Marathon running became something different in Beijing. Wanjiru broke the Olympic record by nearly three minutes, winning in 2:06:32. It was Kenya\xe2\x80\x99s first gold medal in the marathon. Given the oppressive conditions, some considered it the greatest run ever. A certain fear of the distance had been lost. The best runners no longer thought they had to hold back at the start to conserve energy.  Wanjiru would not live to defend his Olympic title in London. His personal life grew messy. He drank heavily by many accounts, and he died last year after a fall from a balcony at his home in circumstances that have never been resolved.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Still, his effect on the marathon has been sweeping. Of the 24 sub-2:05 marathons that have been run internationally, 20 have come since Wanjiru\xe2\x80\x99s blazing victory in Beijing. The current world record, set last September in Berlin by Patrick Makau of Kenya, is 2:03:38, a pace of about 4:43 per mile. At least one scientist has predicted that a sub-two-hour marathon is possible by 2015.

They are much more aggressive now. Guys just go for it.\xe2\x80\x9dEventually, that defeat in Beijing changed from deflating to liberating for Hall. He embraced risk and lost his fear of failure.

Pickup trucks labored behind on the rutted road. The descent became so precipitous that a bicyclist carrying water for Hall flipped over the handlebars and cut his head.

Sometimes when he ran, he conjured the voice of British announcers: \xe2\x80\x9cHe must be in a dreadful amount of pain now, but he must keep pushing.\xe2\x80\x9dHall had begun to reassess his outlook toward running as he prepared for the Chicago Marathon in the fall of 2010. He felt fatigued, unable to complete his workouts. Later, he discovered that he had an underactive thyroid. He said that his longtime coach, the highly regarded Terrence Mahon, began to question his motivation, suggesting, \xe2\x80\x9cMaybe you just don\xe2\x80\x99t want it the same way that you wanted it before.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Mahon said he believed Hall simply wanted to train alone, as he had as a young runner. In any case, Hall withdrew two weeks before the 2010 Chicago Marathon, worried that his career might be at an end. He left Mahon and his training group in Mammoth Lakes, Calif.\xe2\x80\x9cOnce I knew he kind of lost faith in me a little bit, that was a real shifting point,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cMy coach has to believe in me. That\xe2\x80\x99s the most important thing, probably.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  About that time, Hall also began to feel what he called a \xe2\x80\x9cdesperation for God,\xe2\x80\x9d a desire to make God a more constant part of his daily life, \xe2\x80\x9cto step out in faith and take risks with him.\xe2\x80\x9dAt Stanford, with school and running going poorly, he had taken a semester off in the winter of 2003 to help redirect his life.\xe2\x80\x9cI was a runner who happened to be a Christian,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cI needed to become a Christian who happened to be a runner.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Last August, Hall and his wife moved to Redding and joined Bethel Church.

She said she spent a few minutes in one of the church\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9chealing rooms.\xe2\x80\x9d Hands were laid on her feet, prayers were said. Comforting words were spoken: \xe2\x80\x9cGod just delights in watching you run; it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter which place you finish.\xe2\x80\x9dSara said she went for an hourlong run and her foot felt fine.

Before the Olympic trials, classmates ensured Ryan that he would qualify for London and told him, \xe2\x80\x9cYou\xe2\x80\x99re not running a race, you\xe2\x80\x99re pioneering a movement.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Since moving to Redding, Ryan seemed happier, full of energy, free to improvise in his training and not so slavishly devoted to a particular workout schedule, Sara Hall said.

Each day is consumed with a repetitive draining and recharging of energy. The perfect athletes, Hall said, are his dogs, miniature huskies named Dash and Kai, who \xe2\x80\x9cdo their morning stretches, eat right after they run and lay around and do nothing all day, conserving energy.\xe2\x80\x9dHall loads up on carbohydrates immediately after his workouts and follows advice given to him by Mark Plaatjes, a native South African who became an American citizen and won the 1993 world marathon championship: eat as much as you can.

He loads a sermon on his television or iPad and watches while he rolls his back and hips over a softball or lacrosse ball to relieve the tightness; stretches his left foot to manage swelling known as plantar fasciitis; rubs his legs with a tool that resembles a cake cutter to smooth the connective tissue surrounding the muscles; uses resistance bands for leg lifts; and strengthens his abdomen by exercising on blowup balls.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Ryan and Sara sometimes run together on his easy days. Hall also trades ideas with his father, who coached him in high school. The risk of coaching himself is a lack of objectivity, Mahon, Hall\xe2\x80\x99s former coach, said at the Olympic marathon trials.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not easy to say, \xe2\x80\x98I screwed up,\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9d Mahon said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s easier when someone else says, \xe2\x80\x98This is why, and we can change it.\xe2\x80\x99\xc2\xa0\xe2\x80\x9dBut some other elite marathoners coach themselves, including Makau, the world-record holder.\xe2\x80\x9cYou can listen to your own body and take time to recover after training,\xe2\x80\x9d Makau said. \xe2\x80\x9cSometimes, a coach pushes you too much.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Many elite marathoners would not dare skip altitude training, as Hall did for the Olympic trials.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re going to compete against those guys from Kenya\xe2\x80\x9d who grow up at altitude, said Meb Keflezighi, the 2004 Olympic silver medalist who defeated Hall at the 2012 trials. \xe2\x80\x9cAltitude\xe2\x80\x99s important.\xe2\x80\x9dAfter the trials, Hall reconsidered and decided to do a limited amount of altitude training. At sea level, he can run faster and says he recovers quicker and sleeps better. And his church is at sea level. He has some fellow believers among American marathoners. Desiree Davila, who finished second at the 2011 Boston Marathon and will compete in the Olympics, does no altitude training.

The variables that determine performance are complex, said Tim Noakes, an exercise physiologist at the University of Cape Town who served as an altitude expert for FIFA, soccer\xe2\x80\x99s world governing body, at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.\xe2\x80\x9cIf you look at the literature, some people benefit and some get worse, and the general result is no effect,\xe2\x80\x9d Noakes said of altitude training. The placebo effect, though, can be significant, Noakes said. He urges those who believe in altitude training to continue and those who are skeptical to skip it. At the elite level of marathon running, he said, psychology probably plays a more crucial role than physiology.\xe2\x80\x9cThe more stable you are as a human, the better you are as an athlete, and religion is a very stabilizing force,\xe2\x80\x9d Noakes said. \xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t have doubts. God is looking after you. That\xe2\x80\x99s incredibly powerful. If Ryan finds special strength in his religion, it\xe2\x80\x99s much more important for him than training at altitude.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  As his training for London began, Hall planned a longer, more gradual buildup to these Olympics than for Beijing. For the first time, he used a bicyclist as a pacesetter. And he skipped early speed training, feeling that interval work deadened his legs. Instead, he favored free-flowing, undulating runs, each meant to simulate race day. His workouts were infused with rest to keep his legs fresh. Hence the 100 miles of running a week, instead of the standard 120, and a rest day each seven days, rare for a marathon runner.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to challenge some of the things we just do blindly,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like a lot of mileage just kills people. I wonder how many great runners are covering up their talent. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have pop in their legs because they\xe2\x80\x99re running a lot of junk. The marathon today is so fast, you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be fresh enough to run really fast in training.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  God had given him a specific race plan for London, he said in March. He was reluctant to discuss the strategy at the time, saying only that it was rooted in the Bible and based on surprise.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cI feel like the vision God has given me is like a golden puzzle, and all the pieces are coming together,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said.But the pieces never quite meshed.His original plan, Hall said last week, was for an ambitious, even astonishing, breakthrough. He had intended to train to run the Olympic marathon at 4 minutes 40 seconds per mile, about 3 seconds faster per mile than the current world record.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  His plan was based on workouts his father had given him for a 2:02 marathon. And on confiding words from a friend in Redding, whose own conversations with God had revealed an astounding Olympic possibility. After all, in 2007, Hall had become the first American to run a half marathon in less than an hour (59:43). But he pushed himself too hard in his buildup toward London and his body stopped responding. He found it difficult to sustain his desired pace beyond four miles.\xe2\x80\x9cWhat I learned from this buildup is how to take prophetic words,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s more speaking of your potential than fortunetelling.\xe2\x80\x9dShortly after the Olympic trials in January, Hall fasted for a week. Usually, he would have begun to gain 5 to 10 pounds, knowing that they would melt off when training resumed. But Hall was seeking more clarity in his communication with God before preparing for London.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  While he sensed a closer spiritual connection during his fast, he also lost weight and felt his body \xe2\x80\x9cgot into a little hole.\xe2\x80\x9d His hormone levels were affected. In retrospect, he believes he remained too lean for a pair of poor tuneup races \xe2\x80\x94 a 10k in New York in mid-May and a half marathon in San Diego in early June.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Upon further biblical reflection, Hall noted that in 1 Samuel 14:24, King Saul proclaimed a fast as Israel faced the Philistines in battle. But Israel\xe2\x80\x99s victory was incomplete because its army was left in a weakened state. Hall\xe2\x80\x99s pastor had admonished that fasting before such physical exertion was not the right approach, Hall said. At 5 feet 10 inches, he hopes to race at 138 pounds in London.\xe2\x80\x9cI had the right intention, but maybe I went about it the wrong way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.Hall also came to believe that his lack of intensive speed work, based on 5k and 10k training, was detrimental to his Olympic marathon preparations. At the San Diego half marathon, he finished in 1:05:39, more than five minutes off his personal best.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cIn hindsight, I would have incorporated a lot more 5k and 10k training,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. He has begun doing more speed work in the past month, realizing \xe2\x80\x9chow important it is and how behind I am.\xe2\x80\x9dIn San Diego, too, Hall reported a flare-up of plantar fasciitis, a painful swelling of the connective tissue on the bottom of his left foot. It had bothered him for two months leading to the Olympic trials. In March, he had a magnetic resonance imaging test. He also saw a podiatrist, who prescribed stretching, icing, an arch support and sound-wave therapy that causes microtrauma in the tissue and stimulates a healing response.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  By early May, Hall said his left foot still became tight and sore sometimes but that it was gradually improving.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not really worried about it anymore,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.By early June, though, the injury was \xe2\x80\x9cworse than before.\xe2\x80\x9d He had begun favoring his right leg, and the imbalance led to discomfort in his right hamstring and hip. He had gone to a healing room at Bethel Church, seeking relief. One day, while Hall filmed a commercial, a police officer laid his hands on the sore foot and prayed for healing. Hall also continued shock-wave therapy, and by mid-June, the plantar fasciitis seemed to run its course, like a prolonged fever.

He, too, is a renowned tinkerer whose Catholic faith played a significant role in his career. Salazar said he had the utmost respect for Hall, but also believed that God wanted his followers to take responsibility for their daily actions and \xe2\x80\x9cnot depend on him for the answer to everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t believe God is necessarily interested in what workouts I should give my runners,\xe2\x80\x9d Salazar said.

But I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that\xe2\x80\x99s a reflection of some character flaw. I\xe2\x80\x99ve learned to see myself as God sees me. We believe God sees us as perfect, almost as if we have a Jesus suit on, because he died for us and took away our sins.\xe2\x80\x9cIf that\xe2\x80\x99s how the creator of the universe sees me, that\xe2\x80\x99s a very honoring thing,\xe2\x80\x9d Hall said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt builds your confidence.

I don\xe2\x80\x99t have a lot of issues with my identity.\xe2\x80\x9dHe has begun to compress his training, placing two days between his hardest workouts instead of three. And he has quit wearing a watch while he trains, so he will not be discouraged by slow splits or inhibited by fast ones. He says he does not plan on wearing a watch in London, either. He feels unbound this way, running for the joy of it, more closely connected with God.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  What to expect now at the Olympics? Hall admits that he is hopeful and uncertain. He had hoped to be further along in training. It is difficult to gauge where he stands. But his marathon preparations usually coalesce in the final month.

He won one, a silver medal in swimming for the United States at the 1976 Montreal Games; he did not also win a gold medal from those Games. (Bottom swam in the qualifying round of the 4x100-meter medley relay, which the United States went on to win. At the time, only the swimmers who competed in the final were awarded medals. The rule was changed before the 1980 Summer Olympics.)

He had two hits with a solo homer as Detroit opened this three-game set with a 7-2 victory Friday.The Tigers\' six-game win streak is their longest since a 12-game run in September.""We had a little break from each other, saw our families and did whatever we needed to do for a few days,"" winning pitcher Doug Fister said. ""We came back, reconvened, and we played well together. That\'s the biggest key for us.""Cabrera is another key, and that may continue against Baltimore (45-41). He has a career .364 average with 11 homers and 34 RBIs versus the Orioles, going 10 for 16 with six RBIs while homering in each of the last four meetings. He\'s the first Tiger to homer in four straight games against Baltimore since Chet Lemon in 1982-83.Max Scherzer (8-5, 4.72 ERA) will try to extend Detroit\'s roll - and his own. The right-hander is 3-1 with a 2.00 ERA in his last four starts, striking out 33 with four walks in 27 innings.He closed the first half of the season with another dominant performance in Sunday\'s 7-1 win over Kansas City, allowing one run and fanning seven in seven innings.Scherzer\'s 121 strikeouts are among baseball\'s leaders, and a personal best prior to the break.""I feel being able to locate my fastball and, obviously, where my slider and my changeup are, are at the best of my career (in) being able to be consistent with it from start to start,"" Scherzer told the team\'s official website. ""I think that\'s why I\'m generating a lot more swing and misses.""He\'s 2-1 with a 4.05 ERA in three starts against the Orioles, getting credit for a win in his only appearance in Baltimore on Aug. 13. He allowed five runs - four earned - with 10 strikeouts in seven innings.The Orioles have dropped 14 of 20, including seven of 10 at home. They\'re eight games back of AL East-leading New York after trailing by 1 1/2 prior to that stretch.Wei-Yin Chen (7-5, 3.93) hasn\'t been immune to Baltimore\'s struggles. The left-hander is 0-3 with a 5.96 ERA in his last four starts, yielding seven homers during that span. He\'s allowed 12 earned runs in his last three outings at Camden Yards after giving up eight in his first five.Chen had the shortest start of his rookie season Sunday in a 6-0 loss to the Los Angeles Angels, lasting four-plus innings after allowing five runs and five hits - including three homers. That came five days after he carried a perfect game into the seventh inning of a 5-4 win at Seattle.Baltimore isn\'t getting much offense from anyone with five runs in four games, but shortstop J.J.

Fortunately for the Detroit Tigers, it had no bearing on the standings.Coming off a loss in the All-Star game, Verlander looks to remain unbeaten against the Baltimore Orioles on Sunday.Verlander (9-5, 2.58 ERA) is the reigning AL MVP and Cy Young Award winner, and he\'s among the best pitchers in baseball this year, ranking near the top in ERA, strikeouts (128) and complete games (five).""He makes everything look easy,"" catcher Alex Avila said.That wasn\'t the case during Tuesday\'s All-Star game, when Verlander was reached for five runs in the opening inning and was charged with the 8-0 loss.The hard-throwing right-hander had allowed that many runs over 15 innings of his last two starts for Detroit (45-43), which is in the thick of the AL Central race.Verlander was outstanding in his latest performance for the Tigers on July 4, tossing a four-hitter with seven strikeouts in a 5-1 win over Minnesota and setting a career high for complete games.""I flipped what I used to do,"" he said. ""If I went out and had a bad start of a game or a high pitch count, I pitched to contact the last few innings and it would usually go pretty well.

07/16/2012,"[(""Some Observations About the Orioles' 2012 Draft Signings ..."", "" The signing deadline for the 2012 Rule 4 Draft was last Friday, and the big news for Orioles' fans was the signing of first round pick Kevin Gausman.  This is quite justified.  As many commenters pointed out during last week's All Star Game, over half of the All Stars last week who were subject to the Rule 4 Draft were selected in the first round.  Gausman is an elite talent who will likely be named a top 100 overall prospect by every publication before he throws a professional pitch. That said, it isn't very surprising that the Orioles obtained an elite talent with the fourth overall pick in the draft, nor is it particularly noteworthy that Gausman, like nearly every other first round selection, signed.  The fanfare surrounding the signing has obscured a lot of interesting things about the Orioles' first draft under baseball's new Collective Bargaining Agreement and under the leadership of Dan Duquette and Gary Rasjich. The Orioles bonus pool for the 2012 draft was $6,826,900.  The Orioles' total spending against their pool was $6,564,700.  This shortfall is almost entirely covered by the slot allotment for the Orioles' unsigned fifth round pick, which was valued at $262,000.  Since this money is subtracted from their bonus pool, the Orioles only had an additional $200 they could spend without being taxed by Major League Baseball.  The Orioles could have offered fifth round pick Colin Poche his slot value without paying a tax, or offered him as much as $603,500 without losing a first round pick in 2013; money equivalent to the slot value in the middle of the second round.  Alternately, they could have offered up to $441,345 to any of their unsigned picks after the 10th round without losing a 2012 pick.  That sum is equal in value to the slot value for a pick in the mid third round. The Orioles picked fourth overall and had ten selections in the top ten rounds for the second consecutive season.  Under the new CBA, the Orioles saw their draft spending fall.  In 2011, the Orioles spent $7,282,400 on their top ten selections, nearly exactly the maximum amount they were eligible to spend in 2012 without losing a 2013 pick.  They saved nearly half a million dollars under the new CBA in bonuses alone, saving even more by not being allowed to sign players to a major league deal, such as Dylan Bundy received in 2011.  The Orioles were among 20 teams who did not spend more than their bonus pool; only ten teams spent enough to be subject to the tax under the new CBA.  Among those teams are the Red Sox and Blue Jays.  Of the teams picking in the top five, only the Twins and Orioles did not spend more than their bonus pool.  The Blue Jays incurred a larger fine for overspending than any other team, going $441,200 above their bonus pool. Of the thirty highest selected unsigned picks, four were Oriole selections.  The only other team who failed to sign as many early picks was the Pittsburgh Pirates.  The Twins failed to sign three of the thirty highest selected unsigned picks; Oakland, Houston, and Toronto each failed to sign two.  No other teams in baseball failed to sign more than one of the top 450 selections.    The Orioles signed nine players selected in the first ten rounds, which were the rounds that counted against teams' bonus pools.  Only one team in baseball signed fewer selections in the top ten rounds, the Los Angeles Angels.  The Angels signed eight players in the first ten rounds, but only had eight selections in those rounds.  The Pittsburgh Pirates and Detroit Tigers also signed only nine players in the top ten rounds, although like the Angels, the Tigers did so because they only had nine selections in the first ten rounds due to free agent signings.  The Blue Jays led the American League East with fourteen players signed in the top 10 rounds, followed by the Red Sox with 12, the Yankees with 11, and the Rays with 10.    Ninety eight of Baseball America's top 500 draft prospects were selected in the 2012 draft but did not sign, including twelve of the top 100.  Of those 98 unsigned selections, five were made by the Orioles, including one of the twelve from the top 100, Derick Velasquez.  Velasquez was one of only three Top 100 players who were drafted and did not sign who was not a high school player, one of nine JuCo players in the top 500 who went unsigned, and the only unsigned JuCo player from the top 100.  Velasquez was the second highest player on BA's list selected by the Orioles, after Gausman. The Mets failed to sign eight players they drafted  from among BA's top 500, the Twins failed to sign seven and the Indians and  Pirates each failed to sign six such selections.  The Reds, Yankees and Red Sox, like the O's, failed to sign five; Philadelphia failed to sign four, as did the Braves, Rangers and Astros (although they still could sign Florida's Preston Tucker, who as a college senior is not subject to the signing deadline); the Nationals, Rockies, Blue Jays, Dodgers, Athletics and Cubs each failed to sign three.  The other 14 teams failed to sign two or fewer players who they selected from BA's top 500.    Unsigned fifth round pick Colin Poche was the highest selected player from outside Baseball America's top 500 draft prospects not to sign.  Poche was the eighth overall player from outside their top 500 selected.  He was one of only nine players to go unsigned in the top ten rounds and top 300 picks (and as previously mentioned, Preston Tucker could still sign, reducing that number to eight), and one of only two unsigned selections from the top 10 rounds who was not on BA's top 500 list.  Only fourteen unsigned selections not on BA's list were drafted with one of the first 500 picks.  The Orioles also failed to sign catcher Wade Wass who was not on BA's top 500 with one of the first 500 selections in the draft, pick 402 overall.  41 players from BA's top 500 list were selected after the first 500 picks and signed, including two by the Orioles - RHP Nick Grim of Cal Poly, selected with the 522nd overall pick (ranked 389th by BA) and OF Lucas Herbst of Santa Clara, selected with the 792nd overall pick (ranked 403rd by BA). Between the selection of Poche and the Orioles' sixth round pick, twenty five players from BA's top 500 list were selected and signed by other teams, including three of the top 100. The Orioles signed one player from BA's top 50, two from the top 100, and nine from the top 500.  The Rays signed one from the top 50, one from the top 100, and twelve from the top 500.  The Yankees signed one from the top 50, two from the top 100, and twelve from the top 500.  The Red Sox signed three from the top 50, four from the top 100, and seven from the top 500.  The Blue Jays signed five from the top 50, six from the top 100, and eight from the top 500. Often, I see Orioles' fans complaining at the low rankings of the club's farm system.  How can a system with two of the top ten (and now top five) prospects in all of baseball be a bad system?  The numbers above suggest that the O's 2012 draft may serve as another object lesson to those who seem so curious. A note: I know that Baseball America's top 500 draft prospects list is not the be all and end all of draft prospect rankings.  That said, uniquely among the mainstream and publicly available draft prospect rankings, the BA list is made by a large number of writers with their rankings aggregated.  Because of that, I think that while individuals and individual teams may vary widely on the rankings of draft prospects, BA's list represents something closer to an industry consensus than other lists and should do a better job of eliminating outlier opinions.

Mauer homered in the second.(AP Photo/Jim Mone)MoreMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The Minnesota Twins are mostly out of postseason contention.Ben Revere and Denard Span can still put on quite the skills competition.Span had three hits and five RBIs, plus two highlight-reel catches in center field to help the Twins stop their five-game losing streak and beat the Baltimore Orioles 19-7 on Monday night.Revere made two remarkable running grabs himself in right field to go with four hits and three RBIs, Joe Mauer homered and drove in two runs and Justin Morneau had four of Minnesota's 20 hits to stretch his hitting streak to a season-long 14 straight games.''We've been taking a few beatings lately. It's nice to be on this side of one,'' manager Ron Gardenhire said.Chris Tillman (1-1) gave up seven runs in the first and didn't finish the inning, the shortest appearance by an Orioles starter in almost a year. Six of the runs were unearned, due an untimely two-out error by first baseman Mark Reynolds. He hit a three-run homer off Scott Diamond (8-3), but the Twins starter won his third straight decision thanks to the big early lead - and that pitcher-friendly defense.''Basically having a center fielder in right field, it's huge for us because it just allows you to force the hitters to put balls in play,'' Diamond said.Tillman turned in a stellar start for the Orioles on July 4, surrendering only two hits and two unearned runs over a career-high 8 1/3 innings at Seattle, but this time was just the opposite of that.Baseball games are rarely determined so early, but a pair of plays in the field in the first inning essentially decided this one.With two on and no outs, Adam Jones drove what would've been a double or a triple hard down the right-field line, but Revere raced toward the corner and came up with a fully outstretched catch to freeze the runners.''The ball kind of tailed, kind of got in the sun a little bit, so I squinted my eyes and luckily I saw it,'' Revere said. ''I dove and it landed in my glove.''Then, Matt Wieters bounced into a double play, keeping the Orioles from scoring at all, though manager Buck Showalter tried to downplay the effect of Revere's catch, as impressive as it was.''I don't think when you give up 19 runs you can hang your hook on one play,'' Showalter said.In the bottom of the frame, Revere doubled and scored on Mauer's single. The Twins eventually loaded the bases, but Tillman had two outs and a full count on Ryan Doumit. On the eighth pitch of his at-bat, Doumit hit a chopper to first base that Reynolds awkwardly lunged toward with his backhand. The ball glanced off the edge of his glove, allowing two men to score and paving the way for Span's three-run double that capped the inning.The Orioles and Twins sure packed a lot into this matchup, including a balk, an infield fly rule call and even a two-run infield single. That came courtesy of Revere, whose grounder up the middle skipped off second base in front of shortstop J.J. Hardy, who couldn't grab it in time to throw Span out at home and keep the Twins from taking a 10-2 lead in the third.Span made a sprinting, sliding catch of a sinking liner to steal a single from Steve Tolleson in the sixth and sped back to nab J.J. Hardy's drive against the bullpen wall in the seventh. Revere also took an extra-base hit from Hardy with his second long run of the night, in the fifth.''They can cover some ground out there,'' Reynolds said.Span teased Revere, who is four years younger and a fellow first-round draft pick, about trying to one-up him.''I said, 'Hey, you're killing me, man.' Every time I try to make a catch he turns around and dives and flips,'' Span said.Revere has been able to make up for a weak arm with elite range in right, where he's beginning to feel comfortable playing.''It's going to make our team a lot better having me out there with him. We can cover so much ground,'' Revere said.NOTES: RH Samuel Deduno (0-0, 5.06 ERA) makes his second career start for the Twins on Tuesday. He was added to the rotation right before the All-Star break. LH Zach Britton will be recalled from Triple-A Norfolk by the Orioles and make his 2012 debut. He started the season on the DL with a left shoulder problem. ... The Orioles still haven't named a starter for Wednesday to fill RH Jason Hammel's spot. Hammel had arthroscopic surgery on his right knee on Monday. ... The Twins are averaging 5.9 runs per game when Diamond starts, nearly two more than the rest of the rotation. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

He was something of a renegade when he was hired to manage the Mets, at age 40, after the 1983 season. Reporters found it fascinating that Johnson used a computer, which, he said, could choose the optimum lineup. Ahead of his time?

Mauer went 3-for-4 as the Twins won 6-4. (AP Photo/Jim Mone)MoreMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- With each hard-hit single the opposite way, with every double to the gap, with every highlight-reel defensive play behind the plate, Joe Mauer pushes the nightmare of last season further and further behind him.The Minnesota Twins All-Star is getting cheered again by his home fans. He's in the race for the American League batting title again. And, most tellingly, he's making the game look easy again.Mauer had three hits and an RBI and the Minnesota Twins bullpen pitched 4 2-3 innings of scoreless relief in a 6-4 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night.''It's kind of one of those, 'Oh well, it's Joe again' type things,'' manager Ron Gardenhire said. ''We've seen that before. He's won a lot of batting titles doing that same thing. He can flat-out hit. The bottom line is the guy can hit.''Mauer had two singles, a double and a walk to improve his batting average to .333, second in the AL behind the Angels' Mike Trout. Ryan Doumit added two hits and two RBIs for the Twins, who have taken the first two games of the series against the slumping Orioles.Adam Jones hit a three-run homer for Baltimore, but Zach Britton gave up four runs on six hits with a career-high six walks in four innings as the O's dropped their third in a row to fall 10 games behind the Yankees in the AL East.Jones was at the plate with a runner on in the ninth, but Jared Burton struck him out for his third save.Alex Burnett (3-2) pitched an inning for the win and Luis Ayala (2-3) gave up two runs on five hits in 2 2-3 innings for the loss.The game was tied with two outs in the bottom of the seventh when Jamey Carroll and Denard Span reached on back-to-back singles. Shortstop J.J. Hardy's errant throw got past Mark Reynolds at first base on a play that was ruled a hit for Span and an error that allowed Carroll to advance to third.With new life, Ben Revere's bloop single gave the Twins a 5-4 lead and Mauer followed with a single that tailed just past a diving Hardy's glove to make it 6-4.It's been quite a bounce-back season for Mauer, who suffered through numerous ailments last season in the first of an eight-year, $184 million contract. The injuries contributed to a career-worst season and turned many of his hometown fans against him.He hit.287 with three homers and 30 RBIs in 82 games last season, but has been the model of durability this year. He played in his 82nd game on Tuesday night and has mixed his time this season between catcher, first base and DH while resuming his role as one of the game's best hitters. He also made a brilliant defensive play in the sixth, pouncing out of his crouch and laying out to snare a popped-up bunt attempt from Ryan Flaherty.''It's great,'' Mauer said. ''I love playing here. I love putting on this uniform. The most important thing is getting the win. If I can get some hits, that's great.''Jeff Gray, Tyler Robertson, Burnett and Glen Perkins combined to get the ball to Burton after a surprising pitching duel between Britton and Samuel Deduno fizzled quickly in the fifth.''I think the bullpen, everybody is going pretty well,'' said Robertson, who struck out Thome in the sixth. ''It's a confident group. We all pull for each other.''Britton was making his season debut after a long road of recovery from shoulder problems. He had platelet-rich plasma therapy in March and didn't start pitching in the minor leagues until being optioned to Triple-A Norfolk on June 6.Britton gave up a run on a double by Jamey Carroll that tied the game in the fourth inning and was knocked out of the game in the fifth after back-to-back walks loaded the bases with nobody out. Doumit followed with a two-run single off of Luis Ayala and Brian Dozier's RBI single tied the game at 4.Deduno threw a pickoff attempt away in the first inning, then bounced a breaking ball for a wild pitch to allow Nick Markakis to score.The right-hander really settled down next three innings but didn't make it out of the fifth. He walked Markakis and Jim Thome and served up a three-run blast to Jones, his 21st of the season, that made it 4-1.Deduno gave up four runs - three earned - on six hits with five walks and five strikeouts in 4 1-3 innings.NOTES: The Orioles had a web gem of their own in the eighth when Reynolds tracked a foul ball back toward the seats and made the catch as he tumbled into the stands to retire Dozier. ... Mauer's single in the seventh gave him 1,198 hits for his career, moving him past Chuck Knoblauch for eighth in franchise history. ... Orioles manager Buck Showalter said they wouldn't rush 2B Brian Roberts' decision on whether to have surgery to repair a groin injury that put the oft-injured Roberts on the DL on July 3. ''It's a pretty serious decision,'' Showalter said. ''Surgery takes him out for the year.'' ... Twins 3B Trevor Plouffe extended his hitting streak to 15 games with an infield single in the second. ... Twins RHP Carl Pavano (shoulder) continues to show improvement while playing long toss. He threw on Tuesday and plans to again on Thursday and Saturday before throwing off of a mound on Sunday, if all goes well. ... The Twins will go to LHP Francisco Liriano (3-8, 4.93) on Wednesday night in the third gamer of the series. Liriano has been superb since rejoining the rotation and struck out 15 in his previous start. He'll face Orioles RHP Tommy Hunter (3-4, 6.11), who is being recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to make the start. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"
07/19/2012,"[('Orioles-Twins Preview - yahoo.com', 'The Baltimore Orioles have been plagued by poor pitching recently, but they hope Wei-Yin Chen can help them build off one of their better performances of this month.Chen takes the mound Thursday as the visiting Orioles try to salvage a split of a four-game series versus the AL-worst Minnesota Twins.After leading the AL East in early June, Baltimore has fallen 10 games back of New York. The Orioles (47-44) snapped a three-game losing streak with a 2-1 victory over Minnesota on Wednesday, just their second win in eight games and eighth in 25 contests.Adam Jones hit a two-run homer in the first inning and Tommy Hunter pitched into the eighth - the longest outing by a Baltimore starter since Chris Tillman went into the ninth at Seattle on July 4.""We needed this win badly, just as a psyche,"" said Jones, who homered for the second straight game to give him 22 for the season.""We know we can play good baseball, and we haven\'t been. It\'s a testament to always grinding. That\'s what you have to do.""Poor pitching has been a big reason for Baltimore\'s slide. Tillman didn\'t make it out of the first inning Monday, then Zach Britton failed to record an out in the fifth Tuesday. Orioles starters have a 5.47 ERA over the last 25 games - nearly a full run higher than over their first 66 contests.Baltimore will turn to Chen (7-5, 3.80 ERA) as it tries to win back-to-back games for the second time in the last month. Chen is the only pitcher who has remained in the Orioles\' rotation the whole season, with others battling injuries and ineffectiveness.He is winless in his last five starts, although he is coming off one of his better outings. The left-hander gave up one run and two hits in six innings of an 8-6, 13-inning win over Detroit on Saturday after going 0-3 with a 5.96 ERA over his previous four starts.""I wanted to go deep and be consistent, and after the first inning I felt really strong,"" Chen told the Orioles\' official website through his interpreter. ""I finished strong. And I just feel great that I can help the team to get a win.""He\'ll face a Minnesota team that totaled 25 runs in the first two games of this series before going 0 for 6 with runners in scoring position Wednesday. Joe Mauer finished 0 for 4 after batting .400 over his previous 23 games.The Twins (38-53) will hand the ball to Cole De Vries (2-2, 4.37), who was shelled his last time out, giving up a season-high seven runs and three homers Saturday in five innings of a 9-3 loss to Oakland.""This is just one of those outings that wasn\'t very good,"" De Vries said. ""We all have them. That\'s why I\'m going to try to make my next one as good as I can.""The rookie right-hander had posted a 2.57 ERA in his first five major league starts. This will be his first time facing Baltimore.It\'s unclear if Minnesota manager Ron Gardenhire will be back in the dugout after leaving Wednesday\'s game with a stomach illness. Bench coach Scott Ullger took over and Gardenhire is expected to be fine.

(AP Photo/Genevieve Ross)MoreMINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Back from the minors, Tommy Hunter needed to re-establish himself on the mound.All of the Baltimore Orioles needed a pick-me-up, actually, and Adam Jones had just the remedy.Jones hit a two-run homer in the first inning against Francisco Liriano, and the Orioles hung on to beat the Minnesota Twins 2-1 on Wednesday night.''We needed this win badly, just as a psyche,'' said Jones, who homered for the second straight game to give him 22 for the season.''We know we can play good baseball, and we haven't been. It's a testament to always grinding. That's what you have to do.''Josh Willingham's home run in the fourth was all Minnesota could manage against Hunter (4-4), who returned to Baltimore's stumbling rotation with a solid performance that lasted one out into the eighth inning.''Hopefully we've got to the top of the hill and we're on that downward slope. It's got to get better at some point,'' Hunter said.Liriano (3-9) recovered after giving up the ball Jones crushed into the back of the second deck in left field, striking out 10 batters in six innings. His 25 strikeouts over his past two starts are a career best for consecutive outings, and this was only the third time he's posted back-to-back strikeout totals in the double digits.But Hunter allowed only six hits to the Twins, who scored 25 runs over the first two games of the series and have the second-best batting average in baseball since June 1.The right-hander struck out just one but didn't walk anybody, giving the bullpen a much-needed break and helping the Orioles win for only the second time in their past eight games.Jim Johnson shook off his past two shaky appearances to post his 27th save in 29 attempts despite yielding a leadoff single to Trevor Plouffe. Brian Dozier popped a bunt up high enough that first baseman Mark Reynolds raced in for a diving catch for the first out.With the trade deadline looming at the end of the month, Liriano's contract expiring after the season and another handful of scouts from around the majors in attendance, the left-hander didn't disappoint. He walked three but allowed only four hits, and in 10 starts since returning to the rotation on May 30 he has 77 strikeouts.The Twins had a bunch of chances to hand him a victory.Joe Mauer grounded into a double play to end the first inning, and Ben Revere did the same in the third after consecutive singles to start that frame. Hunter helped himself with a slick between-the-legs pick-up of Revere's sharp comebacker.''Merry Christmas,'' Hunter said. ''When the ball's hit that hard, you just put your glove in a general area and hope it lands inside.''Revere shook his head.''It was an off-speed pitch, and I was waiting for it and put a good bat on the ball and it somehow found his glove,'' he said. ''It's the way baseball goes.''Then in the seventh inning, with two on and one out, Hunter retired the next two batters on pop-ups.Hunter struck out Jamey Carroll to start the eighth, and Orioles manager Buck Showalter brought left-hander Troy Patton in with three straight lefties at the top of the lineup.Denard Span walked, Revere singled and Mauer moved them over with a soft groundout. Willingham was intentionally walked to load the bases and bring up Justin Morneau, who bounced out to second base.''It's no secret that good defense follows around people who throw strikes,'' Showalter said.Hunter was the third straight starter recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to take the mound for the Orioles, following Chris Tillman on Monday and Zach Britton on Tuesday. He's one of nine guys to take a turn this season. Their starting pitching has been in rough shape, with the knee injury to Jason Hammel last week and youngsters Jake Arrieta and Brian Matusz sent back to the minors.Hunter hasn't had much help. In his past 12 starts, spanning his time in Triple-A, the Orioles have scored 34 runs - and 11 of those came on one night. Shortstop J.J. Hardy, in one of the worst slumps of all of them, a 6-for-66 slide and a .165 batting average since June 1, came through with a key single before Jones went deep.NOTES: Twins manager Ron Gardenhire went home with a stomach virus in the fifth inning, and bench coach Scott Ullger took over. ... To make room for Hunter, the Orioles designated RH reliever Brad Bergesen for assignment, one day after he was brought up from Triple-A Norfolk. ... The Orioles will send RH Wei-Yin Chin (7-5, 3.80 ERA), the only member of their opening day rotation still in the group, to the mound for the series finale on Thursday. He'll face RH Cole De Vries (2-2, 4.37 ERA), who gave up seven runs and three homers in five innings in his previous start. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), (""Baltimore Orioles: That's more like it! - birdswatcher.com"", 'The Orioles couldn\xe2\x80\x99t have asked for a better start from Tommy Hunter in the wake of everything that\xe2\x80\x99s happened in the past few days. Hunter of course was called back up from the minors to make the start last night in Minnesota. Keep in mind that this was not done because Hunter was in essence beating down the door to get back to the big leagues, but because the Orioles needed someone to start. The bullpen came into this game heavily taxed; so Hunter went out and pitched seven and one-third innings. Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s final line: \xc2\xa07.1 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 0 BB, 1 K.I didn\xe2\x80\x99t notice the zero walks until I sat down and looked at the line score to write this article. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the other thing that sticks out at me: one strikeout. Hunter pitched-to-contact all night, which kept his pitch count down. I\xe2\x80\x99ve said this in the past, however pitchers that pitch-to-strikeout generally have higher pitch counts because in theory it takes at least three pitches to strike someone out. If you pitch-to-contact you have a chance to get the guy out in fewer pitches. To illustrate that point, Minnesota starter Francisco Liriano struck out ten Orioles last night (there\xe2\x80\x99s 30 pitches right there at a minimum). He pitched six innings and threw exactly 100 pitches. Hunter struck out just the one batter, and went 7.1 innings; he threw 106 pitches in the game.\xc2\xa0I suppose that if it\xe2\x80\x99s not one thing in a game it\xe2\x80\x99s another; the Orioles were only able to push two runs across last night. But then again that\xe2\x80\x99s all they needed. Adam Jones followed a J.J. Hardy single in the first inning with a two-run homer to left field which I think landed in Duluth (MN). The Birds were 0-for-4 with runners in scoring position, however that\xe2\x80\x99s something that barely deserves a mention when the opponent was o-for-6. Josh Willingham continued his dominance over the Orioles with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and that closed the scoring. Adam Jones also legged out a triple with one out in the eighth, however the Birds couldn\xe2\x80\x99t plate him. Again, that\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat concerning because those are situations where you really want to put runs across. They got away with it last night\xe2\x80\xa6but that won\xe2\x80\x99t always be the case.Troy Patton came in from the \xe2\x80\x98pen with one out in the 8th, and after putting a couple of guys on base the Orioles intentionally walked Josh Willingham to get to the struggling lefty Justin Morneau. The O\xe2\x80\x99s put a shift on in the infield and Morneau hit the ball square to the shifted J.J. Hardy who threw him out at first base. In the last of the 9th with closer Jim Johnson in the game Minnesota\xe2\x80\x99s Brian Dozier made a poor attempt to bunt a base runner over the second. He popped the bunt up and first baseman Mark Reynolds made a diving catch for the first out of the inning. Reynolds has been a punching bag for Oriole fans over the past year-and-a-half, however give credit when it\xe2\x80\x99s due; a play like that is huge in the 9th inning of a one-run game.The Orioles came across as Mother Goose\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cHumpty-Dumpty\xe2\x80\x9d in this one; they had a great fall, and they got up. This was a huge win given that the Birds have been beaten around of late. As I said, they do need to improve on the runners in scoring position stat, however often a win like that will start to give a team confidence. Going back to Mark Reynolds for a moment, I get it folks; the guy\xe2\x80\x99s hitting .206 with numerous strikeouts. However that diving play to record the first out in the 9th last night tells me that he wants to win. While he needs to step up his game at the plate, I find it difficult to criticize the effort of a guy that shows no apparent regard for his own well-being in laying out like that for a ball with the game on the line. If I were a member of the Orioles, that in itself would give me confidence.The O\xe2\x80\x99s will get a relatively short amount of time to enjoy this win, as they\xe2\x80\x99re right back at it early this afternoon with a \xe2\x80\x9cgetaway day matinee.\xe2\x80\x9d Today\xe2\x80\x99s game starts just after 1 PM on the east coast (noon out in Minnesota), and the Orioles will send Wei-Yin Chen to the mound. He was great his last time out, however he recorded a no-decision after Detoit rallied in the 9th inning. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Cole De Vries of Minnesota, who\xe2\x80\x99s had a tough time keeping the ball in the ballpark if his previous start against Oakland has anything to do with things. Going back to Tommy Hunter for a moment, I think we\xe2\x80\x99ll see starting today what a service he did for his team (especially the bullpen). Due to his 7.1 IP last night, the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98pen is coming off of throwing exactly five outs. With a quick turnaround today and the Orioles heading to a hitters park this weekend (Cleveland), that\xe2\x80\x99s huge.

Second base umpire Vic Carapazza watches the play. (AP Photo/Mark Duncan)MoreCLEVELAND (AP) -- To Jim Thome, helping Baltimore win its third straight game meant more than hitting his 610th home run.Thome move past Sammy Sosa into seventh place on the career homers list and Orioles beat the Cleveland Indians 10-2 Friday night.The 41-year-old Thome got his historic home run with a towering 418-foot shot off Derek Lowe (8-8) to open the fourth inning.''The big thing is we won another game,'' Thome said, wearing a large icepack on his neck. That's been a long-time postgame ritual to sooth his back that has ached for years, but not put a crimp in his production.''I knew I got it,'' Thome said of the majestic shot.He then got the baseball, exchanging a bat and two signed balls with the fan who caught it.Thome's homer was his sixth this season and first since being acquired by Baltimore on July 1 from the Philadelphia Phillies for two minor-leaguers. He had signed with the Phillies as a free agent last winter.''Nothing Jim does surprises me and I just feel pretty lucky to watch and enjoy it,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''I'm glad he's passed our way. He sets a great example for everybody and works incredibly hard. He plays every game like it his first in Little League.''It was Thome's 189th homer at Progressive Field. The left-handed slugger holds Cleveland's career record with 337 homers. He was a key part of the Indians' power-laden lineup from 1991-02 and returned for the final two months of the 2011 season.Ken Griffey Jr. is next up on the career list with 630 homers.Thome had three hits, including his 449th career double, tying Hall of Famer Joe Morgan and two others for 97th all-time. He also struck out for the 2,526th time, leaving him 61 behind career leader Reggie Jackson.Ryan Flaherty had a three-run homer and Mark Reynolds doubled home two runs in Baltimore's six-run third as the Orioles went ahead 7-1.Miguel Gonzalez (2-1) gave up seven hits and two runs over 6 2-3 innings in his third career start. The right-hander struck out five and is 1-0 with a 2.14 ERA on the road.Asdrubal Cabrera and Jack Hannahan homered for Cleveland, which has lost six of its last nine.''We couldn't do much offensively, but it was a big, big hole to climb out of,'' Indians manager Manny Acta said.Orioles reliever Matt Lindstrom was hit in the left knee by a wicked line drive by Johnny Damon in the eighth. He wanted to stay in the game, but with a 10-2 lead, Showalter brought in Kevin Gregg with the bases loaded and two outs and Lindstrom walked to the dugout.''I'm a little sore,'' Lindstrom said, a red welt on his leg just below the knee. ''I'm icing it and have complete confidence in our training staff. I just need quicker reactions. I put my glove down, but not far enough.''Baltimore took a 1-0 lead in the first on a wild pitch by Lowe. J.J. Hardy hit a one-out double, moved up on a groundout by Thome and scored when Adam Jones walked on a pitch that got past catcher Matt Wieters.Cleveland tied it in the bottom half on Cabrera's 12th homer. Hannahan hit his fourth in the seventh to make it 10-2.Lowe allowed nine runs and seven hits - five doubles and two homers - over three-plus innings. He walked five without a strikeout.''The game speaks for itself,'' Lowe said. ''It was embarassing, frustrating, all of the above.''The right-hander was the Indians' best starter in the first two months of the season, but the 39-year-old veteran is 2-7 with an 8.31 ERA in his last 10 starts - allowing 48 earned runs and 75 hits in 52 innings.Reynolds went 1 for 5 and is hitting .304 with eight RBIs over six games after going 10 for 66 (.152) with seven RBIs in his previous 22 contests.NOTES: Baltimore acquired INF Omar Quintanilla from the New York Mets for cash.

"", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 3, Indians 1: Jim Thome loooooves Cleveland ...', ' Oh, Orioles. I should really know better, but you\'re almost getting my hopes up again.The  O\'s came up big to beat Cleveland, riding Chris Tillman\'s redemptive  quality start and-- for the second night in a row-- homeruns by bash  brothers Jim Thome and Ryan Flaherty, the former a go-ahead blast in the  seventh that carried the Birds to their fourth straight win.I  was in attendance at Progressive Field for this one, and I\'ll follow in  Stacey\'s footsteps from last night and share a few thoughts about the  Cleveland ballpark. First of all, the Indians fans in the bleachers were  very welcoming to us O\'s backers, striking up a nice conversation about  things to do in Cleveland, other ballparks that we might like to visit,  etc. It\'s nice to see that opposing team\'s fans can be accommodating  and pleasant, something we often forget when insufferable Yankees and  Red Sox fans overrun Camden Yards with their drunken, obnoxious chants.One  other note: Looking at Indians fans\' jerseys, T-shirts, and signs, the  two that I seemed to see the most were for Jack Hannahan and Ricky  Vaughn. It\'s probably not a great omen for the franchise when the two  most popular Indians are a utility infielder and a fictional character. On  to the game. Chris Tillman was making his third start of the year,  hoping to bounce back from his travesty in Minnesota in which he didn\'t  finish the first inning.  I\'d say he rebounded quite nicely tonight.  Even though Chris coughed up a homer to the first batter he faced,  Shin-Soo Choo, he was outstanding for the rest of his night. He retired  the next three batters, and then stranded Carlos Santana\'s leadoff  double in the second on a groundout and two weak pop flies.Tillman  got some defensive help on back-to-back plays in the third, with Nick  Markakis making a diving catch and J.J. Hardy ranging behind second base  to field a tough grounder. Tillman didn\'t face any trouble again until  the fifth, when a pair of singles put two Indians aboard with one out.  Unfazed, he struck out Choo and retired Asdrubal Cabrera on a fly to  left.For  six innings, unfortunately, it seemed as if Tillman\'s great effort  would go for naught. The Birds\' 10-run offense from the previous night  was nowhere to be found against impressive Indians starter Zach  McAllister. The right-handed rookie put on a strike-throwing clinic,  going after hitters and pumping nearly every pitch into the zone. At one  point by the fifth inning, McAllister had thrown 49 pitches, 40 of them  for strikes. He had O\'s hitters down in the count early and made quick  work of them, facing the minimum 12 hitters through four. Matt Wieters snuck a double to left in the fifth but the Birds didn\'t score, nor did  they in the sixth.The  O\'s still trailed 1-0 heading to the seventh, but then something  amazing happened. Not only did the Orioles take the lead, but the  esteemed Stacey Long made a 100% perfect prediction about how it would  happen. Before the top of the seventh inning, she said, ""J.J. Hardy will  hit a single. And then Jim-Jam... (points to the right-field seats).""Behold!  As it was said by the Bowser of Camden Chat, so it came to pass. Hardy  led off the seventh with a single into left field. And then Thome burned  his former team for the second straight night, crushing a  no-doubt-about it two-run homer into the right-field seats to snap  McAllister\'s shutout and give the Birds a 2-1 lead. Some people just  have a gift for mashing taters. And some people have a gift for  predicting people mashing taters. Well done, everyone!Tillman  had a lead for the first time, and even though his pitch count was 98  pitches through six, he was throwing so well that Buck Showalter stuck  with him for the seventh. Tillman retired the first two batters before a  Hannahan single ended his night. Excellent job by Chris, who delivered  the Birds\' fourth straight quality start: 6 \xe2\x85\x94 innings, one run, and four  strikeouts to just one walk. He ended his night at 116 pitches, and  lefty Troy Patton retired Choo to strand his baserunner.Ryan  Flaherty, of all people, gave the Birds an insurance run with a solo  homer to straightaway center field in the eighth that chased McAllister.  Flaherty entered the series with only two homeruns all season, and now  he\'s hit two in back-to-back games.The  Birds\' usual end-of-the-game bullpen duo took care of business from  there, with Pedro Strop pitching a perfect eighth inning and Jim Johnson shutting the door in the ninth, fielding a comebacker for the final out  to strand a runner at first. Orioles win again. Bravo, Birds. Way to  represent for your fans who made the road trip to Cleveland!     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He allowed four hits over the next five scoreless innings and didn't walk a batter. He has issued only one base on balls over his last 21 2-3 innings.NOTES: RHP Roberto Hernandez, the former Fausto Carmona, apologized to the Indians and their fans for playing under an assumed name and falsifying his age since signing with Cleveland in 2000.

Can it really be that easy? Friend, if your answer to that question is yes, I don't know what the heck baseball team you've been watching, because of course it can't be easy! This is the Orioles we are talking about here. A 4-0 lead that looked like the rare three-inning save (Luis Ayala entered the game with the score at 3-0) turned into a 4-3 nailbiter that required an emergency summoning of Jim Johnson for a two-out save. Johnson was not sharp to start out - take your pick as to why. The tying runs and winning runs were both on base when the game ended, and you didn't have to stretch your imagination to see the Orioles' undefeated streak when leading after 7 innings possibly coming to an end. Then, Johnson threw a pitch that must have looked oh, so tempting to Cleveland's Asdrubal Cabrera - there it sailed right towards his wheelhouse, and yes, Asdrubal, you can be a hero! Take that hack! Smack the homer out into the right field seats! Oh, I'm sorry, did you make up your mind to swing at that pitch? Because the bottom just fell out from that breaking ball, and now it's dropping, dropping, your bat is swinging, you try to adjust in a split second - but you can't. All you can do is swing and miss, and now the game is over. Good job, Asdrubal. You're the man now, dog. So those were the theatrics. It was almost enough to ruin a great outing from Zach Britton that featured lots of ground balls, several strikeouts, and most importantly, no runs allowed! With four hits allowed against two walks, that's a WHIP of 1.00 for the day, and we will take that, yes. As did Chris Tillman, and even Tommy Hunter before him, Britton resembled a major league pitcher against a decent, if not Yankee-esque, lineup - although Britton had the extra advantage of Cleveland being stacked with lefties.    Meanwhile, on the other side of the ball, three of the Orioles' four runs scored via the home run. There was a graphic during the broadcast that showed the O's have scored something like 48.7% of their runs by home run - the only team higher is the aforementioned Yankee team with something like 52.3% of their runs coming from a homer. The Orioles have neither the sluggers nor the stadium to compete with that, but they are coming close anyway.    J.J. Hardy got things started as the second batter of the game, sending a drive deep to left to score himself and Nick Markakis, who opened up the game with a grounder deep in the hole that Cabrera gloved but couldn't throw to first in time. Though it got close at the end, that was a lead the Orioles would never relinquish. Hardy was responsible for an insurance run - one the Orioles would need, as it turned out - when he drove in the O's third run in the 7th inning. With runners at the corners and one out, Indians third baseman Jose Lopez was playing in to try to cut off the run at the plate, and Hardy smoked a grounder past him for his third RBI of the day.    The 4th, and also necessary, Orioles run of the day came off of a home run from Wilson Betemit, a 438 mammoth blast to right in the 8th inning. That was the 11th Betemit home run of the season; Hardy's first inning bomb was his 14th. About that interesting 9th inning... we could read doom into it if we want. Things just had to be interesting, didn't they? Well, I think when you try to ride a third inning from Luis Ayala, that's about what you're asking for. The inherited runner-scoring machine came in to open up the 7th inning with a clean slate, and he proceeded to send down the Indians in order in the 7th as well as the 8th. He did not allow a hit or walk for two innings. He came out for the 9th, and got a strikeout, but then Michael Brantley singled and Carlos Santana hit a barely-but-still-good-enough home run to right. Suddenly, it was a save situation and it was time to summon Johnson. The bases were empty and there was one out, so he was even closer than usual, right? The first batter he faced was Shelley Duncan, who doubled. It was a long fly ball to left and Duncan was in his home run trot, then barely stumbled around first and into second when it bounced off the wall and back in play instead. Pinch-hitter Travis Hafner, whom I will always find annoying because of that year he was rehabbing during the AA playoffs and single-handedly beat Bowie, singled in Duncan. The tying run was on base for Johnny Damon. Ooh, Johnny Damon. Could we at least not get beaten by Johnny Damon, Orioles? Johnson was listening to everyone who said that, getting Damon on a deep fly to left that defensive substitute Endy Chavez ran down. Two outs! Shin-Soo Choo then walked. Your heart rate ramped up, or at least mine did. Cabrera battled through an at-bat, but it ended in the strikeout, and Johnson had his 30th save notched. The Orioles, who six games ago seemed like they would never win another game, are now winners of 5 straight and are 51-44 on the season. They are in the second wild card spot at this moment - although as Andrew will remind us, that doesn't mean anything until after 162 games have been played. The O's have sealed the series victory over Cleveland, but there is a fourth game to be played tomorrow. They will go for the sweep, and six straight wins, at 7:05pm on Monday. Tommy Hunter takes the ball for the O's against Justin Masterson for the Indians. But seriously though, it is July 22 and the Orioles are in a playoff spot.

''He just impacts a team so many ways. He walks through the door every day with a smile on his face. He's a lot of fun to have around, but he also is a competitive guy. He's locked in on every pitch.

07/23/2012,"[(""Indians 3, Orioles 1: Don't blame Tommy - Camden Chat"", "" The Orioles needed another good outing from a starting pitcher, and they got it. What they didn't get was offense, as the bats went totally cold for the second time this season against Justin Masterson. Even with the loss the O's took three out of four in the series, but as they continue to struggle to score runs it doesn't bode well for future games. Tonight's starting pitcher, Tommy Hunter, again did as much as we can ask from Tommy Hunter. He pitched seven strong innings before he things began to unravel in the eighth inning, and his main trouble was with Shin-Soo Choo, who was a maniac over the last few games. By the end of tonight's game I wondered why they pitched to him at all this series the way he knocked them around. The Orioles squandered a chance to score in the second inning when a leadoff double from Adam Jones turned into a joke. After Matt Wieters K'd for the first out, Wilson Betemit hit a grounder to the pitcher. Jones ran on the pitch and Masterson threw to third base to get him. Jones managed to get himself into a rundown which would hopefully give Betemit a chance to get to second. Betemit just stood on first like a statue though, and eventually Adam was tagged out. After blowing their opportunity in the top of the inning, the O's allowed the Indians to take the lead in the bottom. With Casey Kotchman on first base, Choo hit a home run. This guy! The two runs were all the Indians would need tonight.    Masterson worked around leadoff singles in the third and fourth innings, but the Orioles got to him for their one and only run in the fifth. With two outs, Masterson hit Ryan Flaherty. That brought new Oriole Omar Quintanilla to the plate looking for his first hit as an Oriole. And he got it! His line drive got past Michael Brantley in centerfield as Flash Flaherty scored from first. Quintanilla ended up on second with a double. Masterson lost it for a bit at that point, walking Nick Markakis on four pitches and going 3-0 to Endy Chavez. But with Jim Thome on deck Masterson remembered he was pitching to Endy Chavez and threw three straight fastballs down the middle. The first was a called strike, the second was fouled off, and the third one Endy smoked for a line drive that unfortunately went right to Kotchman at first. The Orioles only sent three batters to the mound in each of the sixth and seventh innings, thanks to two double plays (good job, guys!), and in the eighth they blew a prime chance to tie the game. After Q-Bert (Quintanilla is just too many letters) made the first out, Markakis singled to centerfield. That was it for Masterson, which seemed like a quick hook to me. He was only at 92 pitches and he seemed to have the game in hand. At any rate, Masterson was replaced by Vinnie Pestano, who embarrassingly gave up a double to Chavez. Markakis was racing around the bases and as he got to third base DeMarlo Hale threw up a stop sign as left fielder Aaron Cunningham was just coming up with the ball. Markakis blew through the stop sign, which was mistake #1. Mistake #2: Once he realized that he ran the stop sign, he just stopped. He didn't steam towards home and hope that Cunningham made a bad throw, he didn't race back to third base as fast as he could. He just kind of looked confused. Needless to say, he got tagged out. Chavez ended up on third while Nick halfheartedly got himself into a rundown, but Thome struck out to end the inning.    With a low pitch count and a solid handle on the game, Hunter returned for the eighth inning. He didn't quite have enough for another inning, though, as the Indians greeted him with back-to-back singles. The first was a solid hit from (who else) Choo, but the second was a tough luck infield grounder that died. Buck Showalter decided to go with Troy Patton from the bullpen, but it didn't really work out. Another infield single loaded the bases for Brantley, who singled in one run. Patton did an admirable job after that, though, getting two more outs without allowing another run. Darren O'Day came in to get the final out. Down 3-1 going into the ninth inning, the Indians sent in Chris Perez to lock down the win, and lock it down he did. Jones, Wieters, and Betemit were required easily to end the game.

Here\'s the problem: findamentally, this isn\'t a good baseball team. var adSkipCounter = 0; ... Their good record in the first six weeks was driven by a bullpen, pitching, to a man, way over its head, and some late-game and extra-inning longballs that bolstered the team\'s performance in close games.Those games are banked and keeping the Orioles in the race, but it\'s a mirage. . . There\'s not much here to sell -- \'hold\' may be the better term to use -- but the Orioles have no business buying.** Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports says the Orioles should resist the urge to unload talent while the rest of the\xc2\xa0AL East goes into buy mode:(The)Baltimore Orioles aren\'t playing out of their minds. So much so that it\'s unfortunate, actually, because they\'d make a great sell candidate if doing so wouldn\'t murder a fan base that\'s already so alienated it should reside in Roswell.Jim Johnson is a perfect sell-high guy, one year shy6 of free agency and excelling, and if the Rays hold onto (Fernando)\xc2\xa0Rodney and Huston Street signs an extension with San Diego, the relief market would pay top dollar for Johnson. It might be nice to sell off Nick Markakis, whose $15 million salary could be well-positioned elsewhere, but no chance that happens, owner Peter Angelos\' irrational love for Markakis what it is.Here\'s the thing: the Orioles aren\'t good enough to buy. Injuries rendered their rotation a mess, they\'ve got a minus-44 run differential and no matter how great a job manager Buck Showalter and GM Dan Duquette have done -- and quite great is the answer -- sacrificing more surprising years for the quick high of one is impractical.** ESPN.com lists the Orioles at No. 16 in their power rankings and says the O\'s have gotten hot at exactly the right time:The Orioles finished the week with five straight victories over the Twins and Indians -- exactly the type of run periodicially required if they are to stay in the thick of the wild-card hunt through the dog days.The momentum comes at the best time possible, with nine of their next 13 games (after Monday\'s game against Cleveland) being potentially impactful meetings with the Yankees and Rays.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

But there was a time when those roles were reversed.As postgame notes issued by the Athletics mentioned, the four-game sweep of the Yankees was the second time the franchise had accomplished the feat since 1914. The curious part is why the Athletics did not mention the team\xe2\x80\x99s history of sweeps before that.In 1913, playing as the Yankees for the first time after having previously been known as the Highlanders, New York was in the role of David against the mighty Philadelphia Athletics, led by the Hall of Fame manager Connie Mack.The underdog did not triumph that time, with the Goliath-like Athletics pulling off a four-game sweep of the Yankees three times in one year on the way to the club\xe2\x80\x99s third World Series championship. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      It was nothing new for the Athletics, as they often had their way with the franchise.In 1909 the Athletics swept a five-game series against the Highlanders despite being on the road. Mack\xe2\x80\x99s 1902 team needed only two days to complete a four-game sweep of the Baltimore Orioles, the first incarnation of the current Yankees franchise, taking both ends of doubleheaders on Sept. 10 and 11.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The teams\xe2\x80\x99 fortunes changed drastically over the decade after the Athletics\xe2\x80\x99 dominance of 1913.Starting in 1915, Connie Mack began a seesaw effect of building winners and breaking them up soon after that, a process that continues to this day and has led to 10 100-win seasons, 16 100-loss seasons and nine World Series championships. As for New York, Babe Ruth arrived in 1920 and changed the team\xe2\x80\x99s fortunes for good, beginning a run of success that has rarely abated.

Privacy Policy    In this most recent sweep, there were reasons for both teams to be hopeful.The Athletics continued to show a knack for storming back, adding two more wins on the final play to the team\xe2\x80\x99s major-league-best 11 this season. The young starting rotation was able to show why Trevor Cahill and Gio Gonzalez, both traded away by Oakland in the off-season, have not been missed. The team even fought through the first struggles of the All-Star rookie closer Ryan Cook, who allowed the first two home runs of his career but managed not to have either cost the team a win.In a six-game homestand against the Yankees and the Texas Rangers, the teams with the best records in the American League, the Athletics went 5-1, and they are 14-2 in July.The Yankees can find solace in the fact that despite the sweep, they still have the best record in the majors. While the team\xe2\x80\x99s bats abandoned it against a top young pitching staff and closer Rafael Soriano appeared human for the first time in months, the long-term damage was minimal and the Yankees can reasonably expect to return to normal once they are facing a club that is not as hot as the Athletics.It is unlikely, considering market size, that the teams\xe2\x80\x99 roles will reverse again, at least in a long-term sense, but the scrappy Athletics, tied for the second American League wild card heading into Monday, made a statement with this sweep to any potential playoff opponents that they are not just a feel-good story but also a force to be reckoned with.

Rosenthal included this nugget:  The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 terrific bullpen, on the other hand, enables the club to  win an inordinate number of close games \xe2\x80\x94 the O\xe2\x80\x99s are 10-2 in extra  innings and 19-6 in one-run outcomes.  I was going to write about this, but then we had a terrific pow-wow in the comments of yesterday\'s Bird Droppings, and then SBNation\'s Jeff Sullivan pretty much wrote what I had to say anyway, including this bit:  There is no ""myth"" here. The Baltimore Orioles without question have a  better record than they should based on their performance. The  expectation is that they\'ll fade before the playoffs, and that\'s  perfectly justifiable. But what also matters is that the Orioles are  still in the hunt, and when a team is in the hunt at the end of July,  you can never dismiss the possibility that it\'ll remain in the hunt  until the very end. There\'s no such thing as retroactive regression. The  Orioles aren\'t going to give any wins back. All they have to do is win  games from now on, and that\'s easier over two months than six months.     That\'s pretty much what I had to say in this week\'s CamdenCast. Except, of course, Sullivan said it better than me. Now go tweet at him about how happy you are Ichiro is finally in New York where he has always belonged.    Sullivan also included a interesting note that I never really pondered until today, and this is where I\'m going to focus my energies for now:  The Reds have had baseball\'s best bullpen, and they\'re 17-16 in one-run games. The Pirates and A\'s have the next-lowest bullpen ERAs, and while they\'ve been good in one-run games, they haven\'t been Orioles-good. And of course, the Orioles\' bullpen probably isn\'t as good as its ERA.     Rosenthal mentioned it, and it\'s kind of just been accepted as gospel, but is the bullpen - which is pretty much where the Orioles have to hang their hat - really the reason for this insanely good record in 1 run ballgames? If it is, and the bullpen doesn\'t regress too quickly then that\'s some solid science backing the idea of the Orioles as a legit playoff contender. If it isn\'t, then it\'s just more noise keeping you from an unfortunate reality. So how do we ponder this question? I think the most robust, if not best, strategy is to consider each of the Orioles\' 25 games so far this season that have been decided by 1 run. So let\'s get started. 1) 4/10: 4-5 loss to NYY  Wei-Yin Chen went 5.2 innings, turning it over to Matt Lindstrom with runners on the corners and the score tied 4-4. Lindstrom, Luis Ayala, Jim Johnson, and Troy Patton all saw scoreless action before Pedro Strop gave up doubles to Robinson Cano and Raul Ibanez in the 12th. 6.1 IP, 8 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 1 R, 5 H, 0 IRS, L 2) 4/17: 3-2 win over CHW Chen this time only goes 5.1 innings, turning over a 3-2 lead to Darren O\'Day. O\'Day pitches out of a jam in the 6th, and then he, Patton, and Ayala provide the bridge to Jim Johnson. Johnson loads the bases in the 9th but registers the save. 3.2 IP, 2 K, 2 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 1 H, 0 IRS, SV 3) 4/22: 3-2 win over LAA  Coincidentally, Chen is again the starter. This time he goes 6.1 innings and departs with the Angels winning 1-0 and 2 runners on base. O\'Day induces the double play ball to get out of it. The O\'s grab the lead in the next half inning, but Pedro Strop gives up a tying home run to Howie Kendrick. Fortunately, the offense gets Strop the patented ""BS Win"" in the 10th inning and Johnson works around a 1-out double to record his 7th save. 3.2 IP, 5 K, 0 NIBB, 1 HR, 1 R, 3 H, 0 IRS, BS, W, SV 4) 4/24: 2-1 win over TOR Troy Patton takes over from Tommy Hunter for the start of the 7th inning, nursing the 2-1 lead and not a whole heck of a lot else happens. Pedro Strop does his part to disprove the ""proven closer"" thing, slamming the door on the Blue Jays in the 9th. 3 IP, 3 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 2 H, 0 IRS, SV 5) 4/30: 1-2 loss to NYY The pen does what it can, registering 2 perfect innings, but it inherited a 2-1 deficit. 2 IP, 1 K, 0 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 0 H, 0 IRS 6) 5/10: 6-5 win over TEX  Wei Yin leaves with a five run lead in the eighth, and Luis Ayala does his job, inducing a two out grounder to third to escape his inherited jam. The defense boots it, though, and a runner scores. Jim Johnson is less than spectacular himself, giving up a three run bomb to Daniel Murphy. Not a good game for the bullpen. 1.1 IP, 2 K, 0 NIBB, 1 HR, 3 R, 3 H, 1 IRS, SV 7) 5/11: 4-3 win over TB This was the first Dana Eveland game, and Darren O\'Day came on in the 7th with the Rays winning 3-2. O\'Day, Strop, and Johnson were all perfect, and a timely Nick Johnson home run sealed up the win for the birds. 3 IP, 1 K, 0 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 0 H, 0 IRS, W, SV 8) 5/13: 9-8 loss to TB Jake Arrieta logged a disaster start, and Kevin Gregg relieved him in the 4th with the score 7-1 Rays. This was a tremendous game for the relievers - Troy Patton gave up back to back homers in the 8th to quell the O\'s comeback efforts - but to no avail. 5.1 IP, 7 K, 1 NIBB, 2 HR, 2 R, 3 H, 0 IRS 9) 5/16: 4-3 win over KC  Tommy Hunter went 7 strong innings, but left the game losing 2-1. A wild comeback in the 9th off Jonathon Broxton sent the game into extras. A bunch of relievers got into this game, including Dana Eveland for three stress-free extra innings and Kevin Gregg for two, before the Orioles won in the 15th. 8 IP, 6 K, 1 NIBB, 1 R, 5 H, 0 IRS, W, SV 10) 5/18: 2-1 win over WAS  Jake Arrieta was great, he threw seven innings and left with the game tied 1-1. The bullpen was again fantastic giving up just one hit in the 11th. Strop got the save, working around that hit and a lead-off HBP. 4 IP, 1 K, 0 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 1 H, 0 IRS, W, SV 11) 5/19: 6-5 win over WAS Jason Hammel left the game with the O\'s winning 6-1, but Luis Ayala let both his inherited runners score. Ryan Zimmerman homered off Jim Johnson in the ninth to make it close. 3.2 IP, 3 K, 1 NIBB, 1 R, 4 H, 1 HR, 2 IRS, SV 12) 5/23: 5-6 loss to BOS Arrieta turned the game over to Ayala in the 6th with the Red Sox up 3-2. Ayala gave up a homer to his first batter and then O\'Day gave up another homer in the 8th, keeping the game out of a comeback reach. 3.1 IP, 2 K, 0 NIBB, 2 HR, 2 R, 5 H, 1 IRS 13) 5/26: 3-4 loss to KC Darren O\'Day took over after Chen pitched 6 innings. O\'Day had a 3-2 lead, but gave up back-to-back doubles to blow the lead. Pedro Strop loaded the bases and gave up a single to Eric Hosmer to lose the game in the 8th. 3 IP, 3 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 2 R, 6 H, 0 IRS, BS, L   Let\'s take a quick break. May wasn\'t especially kind to this particular narrative. The bullpen blew one game entirely, and were generally bad in four of the eight games in question. On June 1st, the Orioles were 29-22 and had just a +8 run differential on the season. The O\'s were at this point 8-5 in one run games.   14) 6/2: 2-1 win over TB Brian Matusz was really good (believe it or not), but gave Pedro Strop a 2 on, 1 out tricky situation in the 8th. Strop loaded the bases on a walk but got the critical double-play ball. Johnson was perfect in the ninth. 1.2 IP, 0 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 0 H, 0 IRS, SV 15) 6/6: 2-1 win over BOS Chen went 7 really good innings, and turned the 2-1 lead over to Strop and Johnson.

Troy Patton stranded runners on the corners and went on to work effective long relief, but things came unglued in the 7th inning. The O\'s were winning at the time 7-5, but six hits in the inning tied the game up. Johnson came on with a two run lead in the ninth and gave up an RBI single to Shin-Shoo Choo. This win was all about the bats. 5.1 IP, 4 K, 2 NIBB, 0 HR, 3 R, 8 H, 0 IRS, BS, W, SV   Okay, one more break. June was obviously a big month for the Orioles\' record in one-run games. They went 6-1 in these games despite going 7-12 in all their other June games. Their run differential in June was +5, obviously, in the one-run games but -25 in everything else. This was a big month for beating up on the run differential thing.   21) 7/3: 5-4 win over SEA Chen leaves with a runner on 2nd in the eighth and 1 out. The O\'s are winning 4-1, but Pedro Strop pours gasoline on the game. By the start of the 9th it is 4-4. Robert Andino homers and Jim Johnson gets 3 quick ground ball outs for the win. 1.2 IP, 0 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 2 R, 3 H, 1 IRS, BS, W, SV 22) 7/6: 3-2 win over LAA Darren O\'Day starts the 8th inning with a 3-1 lead. He gives up a homer to wunderkind Mike Trout, and then a triple to Torii Hunter, but that\'s it for the Angels. Johnson picks up a routine save, his 26th. 2 IP, 1 K, 0 NIBB, 1 R, 1 HR, 2 H, 0 IRS, SV 23) 7/18: 2-1 win over MIN In relief of Tommy Hunter, Troy Patton comes on with the one-run lead, 1 out in the 8th, and nobody on base. He works into trouble, loading the bases, but then back out of trouble. Jim Johnson picks up another ho-hum save. 1.2 IP, 0 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 2 H, 0 IRS, SV 24) 7/19: 4-3 win over MIN The pen picks up in the 8th in relief of Wei Yin Chen, and Darren O\'Day and Troy Patton let the first two batters reach base. Strop works out of the jam and Johnson throws a 1-2-3 ninth inning. 2 IP, 0 K, 1 NIBB, 0 HR, 0 R, 1 H, 0 IRS, SV 25) 7/22: 4-3 win over CLE Luis Ayala and Jim Johnson nearly blow a 4-0 lead in the ninth and nearly ruin Zach Britton\'s first gem of the season. The ship is righted at the last minute, but buttss definitely got clenched in the process. 3 IP, 2 K, 1 NIBB, 1 HR, 3 R, 4 H, 0 IRS, SV * * * * * The bullpen\'s totals for these 25 games are 81 innings pitched with a 2.56 ERA and a 3.90 FIP and 5 inherited runners scored. I further break down these games like so: Bullpen was perfect: 12 games, Orioles went 11-1 Bullpen was okay: 6 games, Orioles went 3-3 Bullpen was bad: 7 games, Orioles went 5-2 What do you make of this? To re-iterate the question, is the bullpen\'s strong performance so far this season what should be credited with all these one-run victories? For eleven of them, the answer is definitely yes, though certainly none of those games featured anything less than good starting pitching as well. The other eight wins, however, have a lot more to do with clutch hitting and good starting pitching than relief help. Strong relief pitching has helped boost the record in one-run ballgames, but not satisfyingly more than strong starting pitching. Only 6 of these 25 games saw the O\'s as a whole give up 5 runs or more. The O\'s won 3 of those games, all with mediocre-to-bad relief work. Everything else featured very good starting pitching first and the relief pitching second. This study can\'t say if the recipe for the racking up future one-run games is a strong bullpen, or if the 2012 bullpen is likely to continue their hot run, or if any other team\'s record in this type of game is indicative of bullpen quality. It also does not look at games in which the bullpen was given a close game that ended less than close. It only says that when the Orioles have won or lost by one run, more often than not a good bullpen performance was there in the spotlight, along with good starting pitching and the weird random baseball flukes of scoring just enough to win by one run.

He was 0-6 since beating Boston on May 16, the second-longest losing streak by a Tampa Bay pitcher since the start of the 2008 season.Asked if he was relieved to put the skid behind him, Hellickson replied, ''Yeah, I am. ... It feels really good. A good team win tonight.''Light-hitting Brooks Conrad homered and Jeff Keppinger had two hits and an RBI for the Rays, who were playing their first road game since the All-Star break. Tampa Bay made the most of six hits in bouncing back from two straight 2-1 defeats against Seattle.''That was a big win for us tonight to get the road trip off on the right foot,'' said Conrad, whose two-run drive in the fifth inning put the Rays up 2-1.After Hellickson left, Jake McGee struck out the only two batters he faced and Joel Peralta worked a perfect eighth. In the ninth, Fernando Rodney got three outs around two walks to complete the three-hitter and pick up his 28th save in 29 tries.Adam Jones hit his 23rd homer for the Orioles, who have lost two straight following a five-game winning streak. Baltimore has allowed three runs or fewer in seven straight games.In this one, however, the Orioles couldn't muster enough offense to back starter Wei-Yin Chen (8-6), who yielded three runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings. The Taiwanese left-hander issued three walks, and two of those runners came around to score.''He deserved a little bit better fate. Their guy was real good, too,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Three hits is going to be tough to win many games.''The credit goes to Hellickson, who kept Baltimore off balance by throwing his fastball for strikes and mixing in an effective changeup.''Helley did good. Helley was more aggressive with the fastball in the strike zone,'' Rays manager Joe Maddon said. ''I thought he pitched a brighter game tonight. I liked it.''Sam Fuld, activated off the 60-day disabled list by Tampa Bay before the game, went 1-for-3 with a walk and a stolen base in his season debut. He had been sidelined since undergoing wrist surgery on April 3.Tampa Bay went up 2-1 in the fifth when Fuld walked and Conrad homered with two outs. Conrad, the No. 9 hitter in the lineup, stepped to the plate with a .180 average and one homer in 50 at-bats.''I hit a slider,'' Conrad said. ''Shortened my swing up, ended up catching it out front and I got it pretty good.''The Rays added a run in the sixth. B.J. Upton drew a leadoff walk, reached third with one out and scored on a bloop single by Keppinger.Both starting pitchers were in control early. Neither team got a runner past first base until the fourth inning, when Jones hit a 1-1 fastball over the wall in center field.

(AP Photo/Steve Ruark)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Orioles had been throttled the night before, and here they were back at Camden Yards trying to avoid a sweep on a hot, humid afternoon.Instead of wilting, the Orioles flourished.Chris Tillman took a three-hitter into the seventh inning, Chris Davis homered and drove in four runs, and Baltimore showed its mettle in a 6-2 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays on Thursday.''It was smoking out there. It's a day you don't want to make too many visits to the mound,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''That's a challenging day. I'm proud of them. Short rest, turn around. That's why they're different.''It certainly has been a different kind of season for Baltimore, which remains in the wild-card hunt following a run of 14 straight losing seasons. Just when it seems the Orioles can't possibly stay afloat, they snap a three-game skid by excelling in all three areas.Tillman turned in a fine pitching performance, Davis carried the offense, and first baseman Mark Reynolds and shortstop J.J. Hardy showed exceptional glove work in the second inning while turning a double play.''This was a challenge day today. It was,'' Showalter stressed. ''Our guys responded.''Nick Markakis had two hits for the Orioles, who had scored only one run in each of their three previous games. It was just the second time in 10 games that Baltimore scored more than four runs.Tillman (3-1) allowed two runs, five hits and four walks in six-plus innings. It was the 40th career start for the right-hander, who was coming off a solid effort in Cleveland and now has won two straight decisions for the first time.''I think confidence has a lot to play into it,'' Tillman said. ''It comes down to getting my delivery right. I put a lot of hard work in during the offseason and coming in, so I'm happy with where I'm at right now.''Baltimore batted around against James Shields (8-7) during a five-run fifth. With the bases loaded and one out, Adam Jones drove in two runs with a single. A walk to Matt Wieters filled the bases for Davis, who collected three RBIs with a double into the gap in left-center.After the Rays chased Tillman by scoring twice in the seventh, Davis hit his 16th home run of the season off Burke Badenhop in the bottom half. Davis hadn't collected more than one RBI in a game since July 2 and came in batting .152 in 30 games since June 15.''It meant a lot especially with the quick turnaround from last night,'' Davis said. ''Sometimes you're going to be hot, sometimes you're not, but hopefully we'll start stringing hits together and put some runs up on the board.''Sam Fuld drove in both runs for Tampa Bay with a two-run double in the seventh. After scoring 10 runs in a blowout win on Wednesday night, the Rays managed only seven hits, went 1 for 12 with runners in scoring position and grounded into three double plays.''It was their day today, it was not our day,'' Tampa Bay manager John Maddon said. ''However, if for the rest of the season whenever we play a team three games and we win two of them, I'm very very happy. You get greedy when you win the first two ... but they've been playing pretty well.''Shields gave up five runs, six hits and five walks in six innings. Although he struck out 10 in a second straight start, the right-hander fell to 6-2 at Camden Yards. He is winless in four starts since July 3.''It came down to three hits and me walking too many guys,'' Shields said. ''I was able to execute my pitches for the most part all day besides the walks.

Although that didn't change his approach, it certainly made it easier for the left-hander to snag his major league-leading 14th victory.Price allowed one run over seven innings, Ryan Roberts homered and scored three runs in his Tampa Bay debut and the Rays cruised past the Baltimore Orioles 10-1 on Wednesday night.Desmond Jennings homered on the game's first pitch to spark a five-run first inning, and that was all the offensive support Price needed to earn his career-high sixth straight win.''Our offense has done phenomenal for me all season,'' Price said. ''Got me five runs right off tonight.''Not that it mattered when he walked to the mound for the bottom half.''That's when you get hurt,'' he said. ''You still pitch like it's 0-0.''Price (14-4) gave up seven hits, struck out 10 and walked none to improve to 9-1 in 11 starts since May 20.After the big first inning, Roberts connected with a man on in the third and rookie Jose Lobaton added a three-run drive in the fifth for a 10-1 lead.Lobaton finished with three hits and four RBIs, both career highs. The 10 runs were more than the light-hitting Rays totaled in their previous four games.''There were a lot of guys who participated well,'' manager Joe Maddon said, ''but at the end of the day it's always about your starting pitcher.''Perhaps, but Roberts deserved a share of the glory, considering he arrived only a few hours before game time after being traded from Arizona late Tuesday night. In addition to his home run, the third baseman scored after being hit by a pitch in the first inning and drew a walk before Lobaton's first major league home run.''It feels great,'' Roberts said. ''First thing was to get here and try to meet as many people as I can. Try to introduce myself to everybody and fit in. Everybody embraced me and made me feel good. So the first thing was out of the way before the game even started. Then, to come out and contribute and play a factor any way possible was nice.''After spending the past 3 1/2 seasons with the Diamondbacks, Roberts blended in with his new club without a hitch.''No awkwardness today. Everything ran smoothly, everything moved slowly for me,'' he said. ''I felt comfortable. Maybe I belong here with this new group of guys.''J.J. Hardy drove in the lone run for the Orioles, who must win Thursday to avert a three-game sweep.Jennings set the tone for the game with his leadoff drive against Baltimore rookie Miguel Gonzalez (2-2).''It is almost like a boxing match,'' Maddon noted. ''Desmond comes out and throws a jab and it hits. Maybe that staggered (Gonzalez) a little bit.''With two outs Carlos Pena singled in a run, and Gonzalez hit two straight batters with pitches to force in a run before Elliot Johnson capped the uprising with a two-run single.In the bottom half, Nick Markakis singled, moved up on a wild pitch and scored on a single by Hardy.Roberts made it 7-1 in the third with his first AL homer since 2006 with Toronto.Gonzalez departed two batters later with this horrid line: 2 2-3 innings, seven runs, seven hits, two walks, two strikeouts, two home runs, three hit batters and a wild pitch.''I didn't have my stuff tonight,'' he said. ''I was trying to do my best but it didn't work out. ... I just want to forget about tonight's game, move forward, and get them next time.''Lobaton homered off Matt Lindstrom in the fifth after the right-hander walked two batters.NOTES: To make room for Roberts, the Rays designated OF Hideki Matsui for assignment.

But anyway, those two gentlemen can\'t slip such literary allusions into their copy, and I can. There are certain advantages - few as they are - to being a blogger. (Do I get to call it copy or is that too pretentious? These are the questions I ask when I want to avoid talking about a horrible game.) This game was an absolute embarrassment for a team that has any kind of pretensions towards staying in the playoff race. Then it wasn\'t, with a wild rally against one of the best pitching staffs (by ERA, anyway) and the best bullpen in the AL. Then, suddenly it was an embarrassment again, as a six-run ninth inning vomited onto the baseball field, a six-run inning following the Orioles dramatically taking the lead back, then having that inning evaporate as the ghost of Juan Samuel that continues to haunt the third-base coaching box to this day sent Jim Thome to an out by a mile at the plate. Seriously, what are you doing there, DeMarlo Hale?  The league leader in saves blew his third of the year and his ERA rose (with an assist from Luis ""And All The Inherited Runners Shall Score"" Ayala) near to the 4.00 mark. There could be no heroics, no extra innings today. The Orioles\' undefeated streak when leading after 8 innings came to an end. The singles, the singles, the endless stream of singles. The torrent, once it began, could not be stopped.    Not even a good Mark Reynolds defensive play to open up the ninth inning - which began with such promise, Jim Johnson with a one-run lead - was enough. Baseballs landed everywhere they could possibly go, except for in fielders\' gloves. There were not even any bad plays for most of it - not for the early parts of the 9th, until a Nick Markakis I-wanna-go-home misplay off the out of town scoreboard cleared the bases (that had been loaded, all from singles and one walk) to get us to the 14-9 final. There were other disasters in the game. This was merely the final one, the one that sealed the doom.    They fought back from others, because they are the Orioles, and somehow they battle, even with an occasionally terrible starting rotation and one of the worst offenses in the game. Nine runs on a night where they could have folded up the tent after the top of the first in which Oakland scored four runs, but fourteen? Just a bit too much, fourteen. Let\'s not forget a game that featured Zach Britton giving up six earned runs in 5.2 innings pitched, six hits, two home runs, three walks, only two strikeouts. He did not have anything resembling his best stuff tonight - or worse, perhaps this was his best stuff. Oakland is not a great offense and they still pasted him. He\'d given up five of those runs in the first two innings, so in some ways he battled to make it as far as he did, but he wasn\'t good, and if he\'s not going to be better next time, what are the Orioles to do?    The next player to follow him was the new roster addition for today\'s game, Miguel Socolovich. What happens when you bring in the last reliever in the bullpen to face a key situation? Well... when it\'s today, for the Orioles, for Socolovich, the answer is he walks the number nine hitter (after Britton had walked the eight hitter), walks the leadoff hitter and then gives up a bases-clearing double to pinch-hitter Seth Smith - lots of that tonight, it seemed, in the four-hour marathon that was this game. There is more to say about that double, because it was one of those Orioles defense plays. Disaster may have been averted, if there was a real left fielder out in left field. There was not a real left fielder. There was Chris Davis. He stumbled on a liner that hung up in the air. A speedy left fielder with better instincts, such as Xavier Avery, may well have caught the ball. In all likelihood, he would have - three runs would not have scored. The last run also may not have scored, because Davis made in a good throw to the cutoff man, but the cutoff man was Omar Quintanilla, starting at second tonight, and instead of making the relay throw that would have destroyed Coco Crisp at the plate, he looked to hold the runner at second. Whatever, though. I mean, when the team gives up fourteen runs there\'s failure on multiple levels. I have addressed the largest of them. Johnson, man - it was bad. Britton was bad, Socolovich was bad, and the defense was bad. No errors were assigned to the Orioles, but Andrew would have been saying ""That\'s a minus!"" left and right, justifiably so. Then there was just the bad luck of every cheap flare, dribbler, and whatever else finding a hole through the infield as Johnson pitched in the 9th. Five singles! The BABIP gods at times giveth, and the BABIP gods, at other times, taketh away. Tonight, they tooketh away, as the Orioles, in turn, took away from our sanity, took away from our hopes, and our dreams, and if you ride the rollercoaster like me then tonight you will feel as if you are careening off the rails, about to crash into a crowd of innocent onlookers. That feeling will stay until the Orioles win another game - which could well happen tomorrow, when the matchup of starting pitchers with significant poundage, Bartolo Colon, and Tommy Hunter, will take place. Should they lose tomorrow too, then we will still await the disaster we have known in our heart of hearts was coming all along this season.

But Baltimore had no answer for Oakland's big ninth inning.''It was like a heavyweight fight. Both teams just battled. It was one of the better games I've seen,'' Athletics manager Bob Melvin said. ''Of course you want to be on the winning end of that because of how much you put into it.''After Baltimore scored three runs in the eighth to go up 9-8, Oakland pounded Johnson (1-1) for six runs on six hits and a walk in the ninth. It was Johnson's third blown save in 33 opportunities.''I fell behind and a couple balls got through,'' Johnson said. ''It just kind of happened. It obviously wasn't my best day.''Johnson got the first out in the ninth before Chris Carter and Brandon Inge singled. Derek Norris tied it with a bad-hop single and, after a walk to Brandon Moss, Weeks put Oakland in front for good with a single to left. Coco Crisp followed with a two-run single and Smith doubled in two runs.Carter and Brandon Hicks homered for the A's, who have won 12 of 14, and Smith tied a career high with five RBIs.Jerry Blevins (4-0) was given credit for the win by the official scorer because Oakland closer Ryan Cook was ineffective in the eighth.The game ended with Oakland right fielder Josh Reddick making a fine catch while banging into the wall. He stayed on the ground for several minutes before slowly rising.Oakland athletic trainer Nick Paparesta said Reddick had an upper body bruise but no signs of a head injury or concussion.Adam Jones and Chris Davis homered and J.J. Hardy had three RBIs for the Orioles, who have lost four of five.Baltimore rallied twice in the eighth against an Oakland bullpen that was 7-0 with a 1.96 ERA since the All-Star break.After walking Mark Reynolds to open the inning, Sean Doolittle got two straight outs before Nick Markakis singled. Cook then gave up an RBI single to Hardy and went to 0-2 on Jim Thome before yielding the game-tying single. Cook hit Jones with a pitch before Davis lined a single to left to bring home Hardy.Thome was thrown out at the plate on a play that wasn't even close. The decision to send the 41-year-old was questionable, but Oakland's big ninth inning lessened its significance.''It was a great ballgame. You've got to credit them. They battled,'' Thome said. ''They jumped out front. We battled. Credit us. We battled back. We did a heck of a job. For the fans, it was a great ballgame. Unfortunately, you know, this is baseball. It's not very fun from this end.''Baltimore used a four-run fifth inning to take a 6-5 lead against rookie Jarrod Parker. After singles by Taylor Teagarden, Markakis and Hardy produced a run, Thome struck out. But Jones hit the next pitch into the front row of the seats in left to put the Orioles ahead for the first time.Oakland answered immediately in the sixth.Orioles starter Zach Britton was lifted in the sixth after walking Brandon Hicks with one out. Right-hander Miguel Socolovich, recalled from Triple-A Norfolk before the game, walked two straight batters to load the bases for pinch-hitter Smith, who fought back from an 0-2 count to hit a 3-2 pitch into the gap in left-center for an 8-6 lead.Early on, the Athletics appeared poised for easy victory.Britton opened the game by striking out Coco Crisp, but Oakland's next four players reached base and scored. Jonny Gomes walked and came home on a triple by Reddick, who scored on a wild pitch. Yoenis Cespedes then singled and Carter followed with his seventh home run.Hicks homered on Britton's first pitch of the second inning to end a 5-for-39 slump, and Davis connected in the bottom half. Twelve of his 19 home runs have come at home.Baltimore closed to 5-2 in the third when Markakis drew a two-out walk and Hardy doubled him home.NOTES: The Orioles designated LHP Dana Eveland for assignment to make room for Socolovich. ...

(AP Photo/Steve Ruark)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Oakland Athletics knew they had the potential to be one of the best teams in the majors.They're now putting that talent on full display, and the results have thrust the surging A's to the brink of the best July in franchise history.Yoenis Cespedes and Chris Carter hit two-run homers to back an effective pitching performance by Bartolo Colon, and Oakland beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-1 Saturday night for its ninth win in 10 games.Jemile Weeks had three hits and scored twice for the A's, who are 18-3 (.857) in July. With one victory in the next three games, they'll finish the month with a better winning percentage than the 1931 club (26-7, .788).''It's been impressive - I think for a lot of people, surprising,'' Weeks said. ''For me, I always knew that this team was going to be somebody that could make some noise, and we're just starting to show that now. It's pleasing to see at this point.''Oakland has scored 40 runs in its last four games, including 16 in Toronto on Wednesday and 14 against the Orioles in the series opener. Saturday night, the A's combined offensive firepower and strong pitching to move in position for a sweep of fading Baltimore.''Pitching's been our strength all year,'' manager Bob Melvin said. ''We've come around offensively here recently. Certainly, the last month's indicative because of our record, but the pitching's been there all year.''Colon (7-8) scattered seven hits over 5 2-3 shutout innings, striking out five and walking one, to earn his first win in six starts since June 12. The 39-year-old is 12-8 with a 3.10 ERA lifetime against Baltimore, dating to 1998 when he pitched for Cleveland.Nick Markakis' ninth-inning homer off Evan Scribner enabled the Orioles to avoid being blanked for the eighth time. Baltimore went down in order only once but stranded 11, went 0 for 6 with men in scoring position and lost for the fifth time in six games.''They're trying. It's just not happening,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''I see them trying firsthand. It's not for lack of effort or lack of attention to what's causing it. When they do hit the ball on the button and it's right at somebody, it's frustrating. But if they keep going it will happen. It's not like it hasn't happened all year.''Tommy Hunter (4-6) gave up five runs and seven hits in 5 1-3 innings. The right-hander has yielded 24 home runs this season, at least one in all but two of his 16 starts.''They hit two pretty darn good pitches,'' he said. ''Outside of that, it is what it is.''Oakland broke on top in the fourth when Weeks led off with a single and Cespedes hit his 14th home run. The Orioles got a hit in each of the first four innings but failed four times to produce with runners in scoring position.The Athletics made it 3-0 in the fifth. Kurt Suzuki hit an opposite-field double to right and scored on a single by Eric Sogard.Carter chased Hunter in the sixth with a drive to left after Seth Smith hit a leadoff single. It was Carter's eighth homer since rejoining the A's on June 29.''We're seeing Chris Carter (be) the guy we all hoped and anticipated him being,'' Melvin said. ''Right now, he's quite a force and one of the reasons that, offensively, we've been so good this month.''In the bottom half, the Orioles got singles from Wilson Betemit and Mark Reynolds before Jordan Norberto struck out Omar Quintanilla to end the inning.Adam Jones grounded out in the Baltimore seventh with two outs and runners on second and third.Weeks singled and scored on a triple by Cespedes in the eighth.NOTES: After the game, the Orioles optioned RHP Miguel Socolovich to Triple-A Norfolk. ...

EncinaBrian Roberts knew going into his minor league rehab assignment with short-season Class-A Aberdeen that it might be the last few innings of baseball he would play this season.A second opinion on the torn labrum in his right hip gave the second baseman optimism that he might be able to return to help the Orioles for the stretch run. An initial review suggested surgery. Roberts wanted to test his own limits, and in his first game with Aberdeen on Saturday, he played the entire game.But less than 24 hours after a 0-for-4 night in his first action since July 1, the 34-year-old Roberts decided he will end another injury-riddled season on the disabled list. var adSkipCounter = 0; Roberts announced Sunday that he\'s opted to have season-ending hip surgery to repair the tear, turning the page on 2012 with hopes of returning by the beginning of next season.\xe2\x80\x9cIt just hasn\'t responded the way we were hoping it would,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberts said before Sunday\'s game against the Oakland Athletics. \xe2\x80\x9cWe kind of knew this was a possibility going into it, but we wanted to give it the best possible shot we could to get back out there and try and help for the last two months of the season. But it\'s not going to put me in a position to play the way I want to play and the way that I think it\'s necessary to help.\xe2\x80\x9dRoberts, who said he faces four to six months of rehabilitation, ultimately decided it would be better to have the surgery now to give himself a better chance to return fully healthy next season \xe2\x80\x94 he said doctors gave him a 95 percent success rate for surgery \xe2\x80\x94 than try to haphazardly get back on the field this season. He has missed most of the past three seasons on the DL.\xe2\x80\x9cI might be able to get out there and battle through 100 at-bats this next month or two of the season, and they might be so-so. I don\'t know,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberts said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the main goal right now is to get ready for 600 good at-bats for 2013. ...\xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s the consensus we came to: Let\'s be ready to go for a healthy 2013 because we all believe that we are having a great year this year and that we will have an even better year next year, and I want to be a part of that in a healthy way.\xe2\x80\x9dThe procedure hasn\'t been scheduled yet, but it will be performed by renowned hip specialist Dr. Marc Philippon in Vail, Colo., likely within the next seven to 10 days. Roberts said he spoke with Ravens safety Ed Reed, who had a torn hip labrum surgically repaired by Philippon in 2010.Roberts, who signed a four-year, $40million contract in February 2009, has been limited to 115 games since the beginning of the 2010 season. After suffering multiple concussions, he returned from a 13-month absence in mid-June, but his comeback lasted just 17 games before he returned to the DL with the hip injury.He was hitting .182/.233/.182 with one homer and five RBIs this season. He is making $10 million this season and is slated to make $10 million in 2013.\xe2\x80\x9cThe good news is the concussion part of it seems to be something that\'s not on his mind any more, so that\'s good,\xe2\x80\x9d Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\'ll go to Colorado and get it done, and he should be ready to go and be a big part of our club next year.\xe2\x80\x9dRoberts said he will remain in Vail for a month to begin rehab, the way the Ravens\' Reed did. Roberts would then return to the Orioles\' spring training complex in Sarasota, where he lives in the offseason.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\'s been a long two years,\xe2\x80\x9d Roberts said. \xe2\x80\x9cIt certainly hasn\'t gone the way I would have drawn it up, but as we all know life doesn\'t always go the way you plan it. It\'s very hard to sit here and watch these guys play those games. I was in Sarasota, [Fla.,] on Friday night. To see the atmosphere in the stadium on TV and to see the excitement in the dugout and not be able to be a part of that after so many years here of playing in atmospheres that weren\'t like that, it\'s really hard.\xe2\x80\x9cThat\'s why I wanted to give it one more chance,\xe2\x80\x9d he added. \xe2\x80\x9cI want to be a part of this, but I also want to do so in a way that benefits the team and isn\'t a detriment to the team.

Chen (9-6) set a record for strikeouts by a Taiwanese-born pitcher, breaking the mark that Chien-Ming Wang set on June 17, 2007, when pitching with the Yankees. For Chen, his previous career high for strikeouts was nine, achieved earlier this season against the Mariners.  Chen also became the first Oriole pitcher to strike out at least 10 in less than six innings of work.  The rookie left-hander gave up just one run on three hits in this start. But Chen also walked four, and he was up to 108 pitches when manager Buck Showalter removed him with the bases loaded in the sixth with a 5-1 lead.  Chen had lost four of his last five decisions, often not getting a lot of offensive support. But the Orioles helped him out more in this game, leaning heavily on the power, much as they've done throughout the season.  Adam Jones gave the Orioles (53-49) a 1-0 lead in the fourth with an RBI double before Wieters came up with runners at second and third and one out.  Wieters came into the game mired in a 1-for-30 slump and had sat out the past two games because of soreness in his right biceps. He flew out in his first at-bat but then blasted a three-run homer this time off starter Travis Blackley (3-3) for a 4-0 lead.  That broke the game open early. The A's (55-46) got a run in the sixth off Chen on a Yoenis Cespedes RBI single. Quintanilla then hit a solo homer in the bottom half for a 6-1 lead.  Quintanilla went 3-for-4, with a single, double and homer. He struck out in the eighth while trying to complete the cycle.  NOTES: The Orioles announced before the game that second baseman Brian Roberts will be having season-ending surgery on a torn labrum (hip) in the coming days. Roberts said he wasn't sure of the date for procedure, only that it's likely going to take place in Vail, Colo., and probably within the next seven to 10 days. Roberts added that the recovery/rehab time for this is expected to be four to six months, and he's expecting to be ready for 2013. He missed most of the 2010 and 2011 seasons with concussion problems and played just 17 games this year for a total of 115 in three years...The Orioles selected the contract of outfielder Lew Ford from Triple-A Norfolk Sunday. The 35-year-old hadn't played in the majors since 2007 but got right into the starting lineup here, batting fifth and playing left field...Oakland made a trade on Sunday, acquiring catcher George Kottaras from the Brewers in exchange for pitcher Faustino De Los Santos. The A's said that Kottaras, who has a .209 average in 58 games with the Brewers this year, will come to the team Monday, and they'll then make another move...This loss dropped Oakland to 18-4 this month, which still is the best record in baseball. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Athletics 6, Orioles 1: Five Runs All Earned Returns ...', "" This game also sucked. The Orioles sucked. Tommy Hunter sucked, giving up five runs, all earned, including two home runs. The Orioles sucked in particular at getting hits with RISP, going 0-6 on the night. They also sucked at hitting for power, with only two extra-base hits in the ten hits they collected - a double by Omar Quintanilla and a complete, utter and total FUHR by Nick Markakis in the bottom of the 9th to break up the shutout - Nick was, perhaps, shamed by seeming to have given up on last night's game after 3 runs had scored in the top of the 9th. Miguel Socolovich came in, ate some innings, gave up a run and then was demoted after the game, probably because of last night. Kevin Gregg generally sucked but gave up no runs because it did not matter, so what else is new, really. The Athletics appear to be a better baseball team than the O's in every possible phase and way, which is a totally depressing and sobering reality check. Stop thinking this team could, should or will contend as the season rolls along. Definitely do not think this team should be buying pieces to make a run. No matter what they buy, there will be no run. But maybe they will find a way to salvage one game in this series tomorrow as Travis Blackley faces off against Wei-Yin Chen at 1:35pm.

They suffered a 3-2, 10-inning defeat to Boston on Sunday, dropping the final two games against their archrivals.The Orioles haven\'t been much better, going 2-5 over the last week as they\'ve been plagued by an inconsistent offense. They\'ve scored 21 runs in three of those games but one in each of the other four.Baltimore arrives in New York after beating Oakland 6-1 on Sunday to avoid a three-game sweep, and Matt Wieters appears to have found his stroke.Wieters, who had sat out the previous two games with a sore right biceps, hit a three-run homer after entering the finale mired in a 1-for-30 slump. The All-Star catcher should be looking forward to this series given that he is batting .467 with two homers and three doubles against the Yankees this year. He is also 2 for 3 this season against scheduled starter Freddy Garcia (4-4, 5.16 ERA).Despite Wieters\' best efforts, the Yankees are 5-3 in the season series.Curtis Granderson has played a role in that success, hitting four homers while driving in seven runs and scoring seven times. The three-time All-Star center fielder could have a couple of new faces on either side of him in the opener.Nick Swisher returned to the lineup Sunday as the designated hitter after not starting for seven straight games due to a strained left hip flexor. He could be back at his normal right field position Monday, meaning Ichiro Suzuki will shift to left for the first time in his major league career.Swisher went 2 for 4 on Sunday, but the rest of his teammates combined for five hits.""We didn\'t really have a lot of opportunities,"" manager Joe Girardi said.It\'s possible the Yankees could have some more chances against Miguel Gonzalez (2-2, 4.28), who is looking to rebound from an awful showing.After going 2-1 with a 2.79 ERA in his first three starts, Gonzalez was knocked around for seven runs and seven hits - two homers - in 2 2-3 innings of a 10-1 loss to the Rays on Wednesday. The rookie right-hander walked two, hit three batters and threw a wild pitch.""Obviously whatever happened didn\'t work out for me,"" he told the Orioles\' official website. ""I just want to forget about (the) game.""Garcia is hoping to build on another encouraging outing after giving up three runs and five hits over 7 1-3 innings in Tuesday\'s 4-2 loss at Seattle. The right-hander, who struck out a season-high eight and retired the final 15 batters he faced, has a 3.90 ERA in five starts since returning to the rotation.In his lone start of the season against Baltimore on April 10, he allowed four runs in 4 2-3 innings of a 5-4, 12-inning victory. The Yankees have won all five of his starts versus the Orioles since 2011.

Raul Ibanez?  Ichiro!?  At times it felt like the  Orioles were  playing the 2006 Mariners.  Remember those intense battles  against the 2006 Mariners?  Neither do I, although something tells me  Ichiro! would have gone 4-4 off Daniel Cabera if only Cabrera could get  through 5.  Anywho.  To that actual game: Miguel Gonzalez, he of  the averagish ERA of 4.58  but not as pretty FIP of 5.50 and WHIP of  1.46, faced off against the  infamous Yankees, who have been averaging 4  runs over thier last 10.  I\'m not really sure what to make of Gonzalez,  and tonight would not change the meter all that much.  After an  easy first and some careless baserunning in the second by Adam  Jones,  the Yankees opened the scoring in the bottom of the second.  With  two  outs, Ibanez would single, get to second on a balk and score on a   groundball hit to right off the bat of Eric Chavez.  Wilson Betemit would lead off the top of the third with a homer to tie the game.  In   the bottom of the third, relevant of nothing, Fred Manfra noted that   Derek Jeter ""respects the game"" which likely increased my blood   pressure, if ever so slightly.  The Orioles would break through  again in the 5th, following a lead off  Betemit single who plodded along to  third after a double off the bat of Mark  Reynolds.  Sacrifice flies may  not be sexy, but Omar Quintanilla and  Nick Markakis would each drive  in a run via the sacrifice.  To make  those runs even sweeter, Markakis  is well on his way to earning the  label as a professional hitter.   Speaking of people paid to play  baseball for a living, Raul Ibanez  would hit a homer in the bottom of  the 5th, cutting the lead in half.    Manfra would describe Ibanez\'s  blast as a ""pretty well hit ball,"" in  case you were curious. More below the jump! Through six complete, Garcia and Gonzalez each pitched decently, if  unispiring.  Boone Logan would relieve Garcia to start the 7th.  He  struck out Betemit and Reynolds, but soon would run into trouble.  Quintanilla  would walk and score on a hard hit double off the bat of Markakis.  JJ Hardy  would keep the line moving by singling through the ride side, plating  Markakis.  After the 7th inning stretch, it was 5-2 Orioles.   After retiring Swisher and Ibanez, Gonzalez gave up a homer to Eric  Chavez.  Following a coaching visit, Gonzalez than suffered the indiginity of  surrendering Ichiro\'s first homer as a Yankee, and his 100th career.  And on comes Darren  O\'Day.  He would do his thing, and retire Russell Martin.  Nothing  especially interesting happened in the 8th, outside of Mark Teixeira being pulled.  Pedro Strop took care of business in the bottom of the  8th.  Both teams would threaten in the 9th, but neither would score.   For some reason a Yankee fan in the first rown behind home plate was  flashing the crowd.  He may or may not be a typical Yankee fan. In the end, I am trying what to make of Gonzalez.  On one hand, he\'s 28 and has bounced around.  His FIP is still well over 5.  On the flip side, through six and two thirds tonight, he was 4 hitting the Yankees.  He likely won\'t amount to very much, for tonight he was on it. Orioles win, now let\'s hope the Orioles don\'t do anything stupid at the trade deadline!     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

He cannot solve any pitching problems, however, and those helped sink the Yankees Tuesday.They lost their fourth game in a row, falling to the Baltimore Orioles, 11-5, at Yankee Stadium. A six-pitch first inning for Ivan Nova quickly disintegrated into the worst start of his career.The Yankees danced to a 5-0 first-inning lead, lending belief that Nova, who has been good and bad in seemingly equal measures this season, could cruise.

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)MoreNEW YORK (AP) -- Miguel Gonzalez has quickly gone from an unwanted minor leaguer with a surgically-repaired right elbow to one of the best arms in the Baltimore Orioles' rotation.Gonzalez pitched solidly into the seventh inning in his fifth big league start, leading the Orioles to a 5-4 victory over the slumping New York Yankees on Monday night.''This is not his first good outing here,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''I think he's given us pretty good outings consistently.''Gonzalez (3-2) cruised through 6 2-3 innings, giving up just four hits and two runs, before he was chased by consecutive homers from Eric Chavez and Ichiro Suzuki - his 100th career home run - that made it 5-4.He missed all of 2009 because of Tommy John surgery on his right elbow. And after going winless in the minors last year, Gonzalez went unsigned until late February when the Orioles gave him a chance. He made his major league debut May 29 and his first start July 6.Other than a horrid start Wednesday when he gave up seven runs in 2 2-3 innings while not feeling well, Gonzalez has kept Baltimore competitive in each of his starts. He pitched into at least the sixth in his three other outings, going a high of seven.After all he's been through, could he believe he was pitching in an important division game in the ballpark in the Bronx?''No,'' Gonzalez said with a smile. ''I was happy to be here and real happy to play at Yankee Stadium and play in front of that crowd. It was a great experience.''Suzuki had a chance to tie it with two runners on in the ninth against Orioles closer Jim Johnson but grounded into a fielder's choice.Darren O'Day relieved Gonzalez and pinch-hitter Russell Martin gave his second pitch a ride to the warning track in straightaway center field for the third out. Derek Jeter led off the eighth with a hit off the glove of reliever Pedro Strop, but the Yankees failed to score.Strop did not have to face Mark Teixeira, though. The Yankees first baseman was lifted before the eighth after he appeared to injure his left wrist while trying to make a diving play on J.J. Hardy's sharp grounder that went through for an RBI single and a 5-2 lead.Teixeira said he hurt the wrist in his third at-bat against Boston on Sunday. Still, he felt as if he could play. Then he tweaked it in the field.Yankees manager Joe Girardi said X-rays on the wrist were negative but Teixeira will have further tests Tuesday.''I've had a little thing in my wrist before, back in 2009. Hopefully it will just get better in a few days,'' Teixeira said. ''You're always playing through something.''Johnson gave up a leadoff double to Nick Swisher in the ninth. With one out, Chavez walked. Suzuki walked to the plate to chants of ''Ee-Chi-ro!'' He grounded to shortstop but, still speedy at 38 years old, he beat the relay throw from second to put runners on first and third for Martin. Johnson struck him out for his 31st save.Nick Markakis drove in two runs and Wilson Betemit homered in the third off Freddy Garcia (4-5) for Baltimore, which has had trouble scoring of late. The Orioles cut New York's lead in the AL East to 6 1/2 games despite winning for just the third time in eight games. The Yankees have lost eight of 11 after opening a 10-game advantage.''We know where we stand, who we're up against,'' Markakis said. ''We just got to take it day by day.''Baltimore hasn't been to the playoffs since 1997 and with the trade deadline looming Tuesday afternoon is thought to be in the market for a starter to shore up the rotation.Gonzalez could help offer stability to a staff that has had nine pitchers start games this season. He struck out a career-high eight without walking a batter but is having trouble with the long ball, giving up three Monday and nine in five starts.''The kid did a nice job tonight,'' Girardi said. ''He was successful with his changeup when he was behind in the count, and he was successful expanding the zone when he was ahead of the count''Raul Ibanez had New York's other homer with a leadoff shot in the fifth. Suzuki's drive was his first with New York and he was greeted with a warm reception from fans sitting in right field when he took his position for the eighth.Garcia tied a season high by allowing nine hits in six innings. He did not walk a batter and struck out two.NOTES: The Orioles are 2-10 on Mondays. ... RHP Joba Chamberlain will make a rehab appearance for Double-A Trenton on Tuesday. ...

(AP Photo/Seth Wenig)MoreNEW YORK (AP) -- Chris Davis could only watch, helpless, as the New York Yankees teed off on Orioles starter Chris Tillman for five runs in the first inning.In the top of the second, though, Baltimore's designated hitter did something about it.He hit a go-ahead grand slam in a seven-run inning and Baltimore beat the New York Yankees 11-5 on Tuesday night.''It felt like the first inning would never end,'' Davis said. ''And then we were able to come out there and take back the momentum and really quiet the crowd.''Nick Markakis had a two-run homer among his three hits for the Orioles, who have won four of their last six, but finished July 13-14, their first month below .500 all season. They'll start August 5 1-2 games behind the Yankees for the AL East lead and right in the thick of the hunt for the two wild-card spots.Tillman said that on Monday, he thought he would be too sick to pitch, but he started a course of antibiotics and felt better on Tuesday morning.''I didn't feel all that good,'' Tillman said. ''There's no excuse to not make pitches early on.''Orioles manager Buck Showalter said he was close to bringing in a reliever for Tillman. But once he made it out of the first, he talked to pitching coach Rick Adair, and made some adjustments and relied on catcher Matt Wieters.''Sometimes you have some outings where you are just not carrying everything you need to, your velocity is down a little bit,'' Showalter said. ''Rick just gave him a different wrinkle and a different toy to play with and Matt getting him through those last four innings was pretty special to watch.''Tillman (4-1) was charged with four earned runs and allowed eight hits with three strikeouts in his five innings.Ivan Nova allowed a career-high nine runs in five innings for New York, which tied a season-worst skid with four straight losses and made some dubious history in the process. According to STATS, LLC, the Yankees haven't led by five or more after the first inning and then trailed after the second since at least 1918. The Yankees have lost nine of 12.Nova (10-5) struck out five, allowed 10 hits and lost in consecutive starts for the first time in his career. He has one win in his last seven starts, and the Yankees are 14-7 in his games.''That's something he has been really good at this year: not letting things unravel,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ''And tonight it did, for whatever reason.''The Yankees teed off on Tillman in the first. He didn't get an out until he fielded Nick Swisher's groundball and threw to second for a force, after allowing an RBI single by Curtis Granderson and Robinson Cano's two-run homer. He later committed an error on Ichiro Suzuki's RBI grounder that made it 4-0. Russell Martin added a run with a single before he got caught in a rundown between first and second. Ramiro Pena finally grounded out to end the inning.The last time New York led by at least five after one inning and then lost was May 4, 2007, against Seattle, when the Yankees blew a 5-0 lead and lost 15-11.By the time Tillman made it back out to the mound, he had a two-run lead thanks to Davis' homer, Mark Reynolds' double and Omar Quintanilla's two-run single - all the runs coming with two outs. He settled down to pitch four shutout innings to hang onto the lead and win his third straight decision.''It's not easy to go out there and give up a lot of runs to this offense in this ballpark and then stay in there and shut the door after that, so I'm proud of him for doing it,'' Davis said.Wilson Betemit helped out by tacking on an RBI double in the third and a single in the fifth.Orioles left-hander Troy Patton pitched two scoreless innings of relief and Matt Lindstrom and Luis Ayala followed up with a scoreless inning each to close out the game.NOTES: It was the first grand slam of Davis' career. ... Orioles OF Lew Ford doubled in the third, for his first big league hit since 2007. The 35-year-old Ford batted .272 with 32 homers from 2003-07 with Minnesota. He played in Japan, Mexico and the independent Atlantic League before the Orioles signed him to a minor league contract in May. ... No major league team has taken a 5-0 lead and given it up that quickly since Washington was up 5-0 after the first inning against the Marlins on July 6, 2006, then trailed 7-5 after two. ...

The Yankees appeared poised to end their three-game losing streak and humble the second-place Orioles with a familiar display of their firepower.  But Baltimore instead left the Yankees grasping for answers, immediately responding with a seven-run second on the way to an 11-5 rout of the Yankees Tuesday night that looked anything but familiar.

New York dropped its ninth game in the last 12.  Chris Davis provided the big blow with a grand slam, and Nick Markakis added a two-run homer and his second consecutive three-hit, two-RBI game for the Orioles. Wilson Betemit also had three hits, his second straight multi-hit game against the Yankees.  Ivan Nova (10-5) had his worst start as a Yankee to blow the early 5-0 lead built against Chris Tillman (4-1). The Orioles righty didn't allow a run after the first, combining with three relievers to shut out the Yankees in the final eight innings.  Robinson Cano hit his 23rd home run of the season for the Yankees while Derek Jeter added three hits.  Markakis' two-run homer in the eighth put the finishing touches on the impressive win for the Orioles, who ended the game 1 1/2 games out of a wild-card spot.  Nova stunned the crowd and prompted boos after blowing the Yankees' 5-0 lead in the second inning, all with two outs.  Baltimore sent 10 men to the plate and racked up six hits during the seven-run onslaught. Nova appeared set for his second consecutive scoreless inning after two strikeouts followed two hits, but Baltimore strung together three straight hits, including an RBI double by Mark Reynolds and a two-run single by Omar Quintanilla, to cut the deficit to 5-3.  After a walk loaded the bases, Davis punctuated the inning with an explanation point. He drove an 0-1 pitch off the top of the fence and into the Orioles bullpen in left-center for a grand slam and a 7-5 lead.  The next inning, Drew Ford smacked his first hit since Sept. 21, 2007, a double to right, and scored when Wilson Betemit also doubled, giving Baltimore an 8-5 lead.  Nova left after five, having allowed a career-high nine runs on 10 hits.  The Yankees seemed set to end their losing streak early, jumping on Tillman for five runs in the first. Cano hit a two-run homer, and Tillman's error helped add to another run as the Yankees racked up six hits in the inning.  NOTES: The Yankees acquired infielder Casey McGehee, along with cash, from the Pittsburgh Pirates for reliever Chad Qualls. McGehee, who hit .230 with eight homers and 35 RBI in 92 games, will help fill in for injured third baseman Alex Rodriguez and first baseman Mark Teixeira. ... An MRI on Teixeira's injured left wrist revealed inflammation, the Yankees announced. Teixeira said he hoped to play by Friday in a best-case scenario. ... Nick Swisher started at first base in Teixeira's place, with McGehee expected to arrive Wednesday. ... Reliever Joba Chamberlain was initially scheduled for another rehab appearance for Class AA Trenton on Tuesday, but he was told to report to the Yankees after they traded Qualls. Chamberlain, who hadn't pitched since June 5 last season, was expected to be available if needed Tuesday, manager Joe Girardi said. He severely injured his right ankle this spring while rehabbing from Tommy John surgery. ... Orioles DH Jim Thome was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a herniated neck disk, the team announced. Infielder Robert Andino was activated from the DL to replace Thome. ... Despite several reports the Orioles were close to a deal for Philadelphia Phillies righty Joe Blanton (8-9, 4.59 ERA), Baltimore stood pat as the trade deadline passed. General manager Dan Duquette told reporters he would have liked to have made a deal, but he felt the club had better options than the players it was offered. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

The result of his ineffectiveness was that he went to the four-seamer and off speed pitches, with which he didn\xe2\x80\x99t faire much better. After the game manager Buck Showalter was non-commital as to whether or not Britton would make his next start in the rotation. Something else to watch is that Showalter used Friday\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled starter, Tommy Hunter, out of the \xe2\x80\x98pen late in the game yesterday. Afterwards Showalter told MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Gary Thorne that Hunter needed to throw about 20 pitches that day anyways, so he put him in the game to do it. That\xe2\x80\x99s kind of unorthodox, however Showalter said that Hunter was still \xe2\x80\x9can option\xe2\x80\x9d to start tomorrow night in Tampa.Speaking of Showalter, I think most people would be remiss if they didn\xe2\x80\x99t agknowledge that he\xe2\x80\x99s done an amazing job in the dugout this year. Here\xe2\x80\x99s the bottom line: when was the last time this team was over .500 and in contention in August? Readers see the title of today\xe2\x80\x99s column; they can see where I\xe2\x80\x99m headed with this. But there\xe2\x80\x99s more than meets the eye than just the bottom line of anything. If an award such as Manager of the Year was based on wins and losses, then it would be New York\xe2\x80\x99s Joe Girardi. And believe me folks, there are plenty of people with whom I speak who feel that it should be based almost soley on wins and losses.First off, let\xe2\x80\x99s not forget that there\xe2\x80\x99s still two months to go in the regular season; for all we know the Orioles could tank the rest of the way, thus ruining my argument. However to this point, we should not forget that this Baltimore Oriole team was supposed to fall flat on it\xe2\x80\x99s face in 2012. Some analysts before the season almost laughed their way through their respective predictions that the Orioles would at the very least make it over 40 wins (the mark of futulity for a 162-game schedule set by the 1962 Mets). Before the season started, it seemed all but guaranteed that the Birds would be out of contention within the first month of the season. Most people that followed baseball on a daily basis probably believed that\xe2\x80\xa6with the exception of one man, and by extention his team.This is not to say that the season\xe2\x80\x99s been a breeze to this point, because we all know that it hasn\xe2\x80\x99t. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s managed the Oriole pitching staff (each variation of it that is) in a superior manner, which at the very least has kept the team in contention. I also think he\xe2\x80\x99s been fair to each of the pitchers. All pitchers are going to have bad outings, however he gave the likes of Matusz, Arrieta, et al, chances to fix their mistakes before shipping them out to Norfolk. The above-mentioned Zach Britton might be on a bit of a shorter leash given that we\xe2\x80\x99re starting to get towards the end of the season and the team\xe2\x80\x99s hot in contention. However with the rotation in shambles at times and with a different lineup almost every day, the fact is that the Orioles have been in contention all year to this point.Detractors would say that the\xc2\xa0other reason that team\xe2\x80\x99s in contention is because fewer teams have stepped up and tried to take over things in the American League. That might be a valid point; however forget being in contention for a moment. The Orioles have won 55 games. My prediction before the season was 72 wins, but that was agressive based on what some analysts thought. Some are probably shocked that they have 55 wins this year overall much less at this point in the game. That\xe2\x80\x99s all reflective on Showalter. I think that the core group of this team learned over the past few years that you always play to the end of games regardless of the circumstances. It\xe2\x80\x99s a lesson that they taught to the Boston Red Sox late last year, and a lesson that they reiterated the other night when they came back from 5-0 down in the first inning. That\xe2\x80\x99s what a good manager can do for you.For the record my prediction is that Showalter won\xe2\x80\x99t win the award, but only because of his humble nature. He\xe2\x80\x99s never been afraid to put his players on a pedestal, and to step in front of a bullet for one of them when needed. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that other managers don\xe2\x80\x99t do the same, however I tend to believe that other managers are a bit louder about their teams than Showalter. And I kind of dig that about the guy to be honest; his team does it\xe2\x80\x99s talking on the field, and not in the print media or anywhere else. That\xe2\x80\x99s how it should be, and how it will continue to be so long as Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s the manager. That leaves it up to writers and commentators to in effect use their bully pulpit to make a case for Showalter. So let\xe2\x80\x99s start here\xe2\x80\xa6based on the expectations of this team coming into the season, Buck Showalter has managed his rear end off and coached this team up deftly. Should he be Manager of the Year? Time will tell, however at this point I think he should be a serious candidate to say the least.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles-Rays Preview - Yahoo', 'The Tampa Bay Rays have the same record through 105 games as they did in 2011, when they made their third playoff appearance in four years.Coming off a successful road trip and possessing one of the hottest pitching staffs in baseball, they seem to have the confidence to make another run at the postseason.Matt Moore takes the mound as Tampa Bay begins an important three-game series against the visiting Baltimore Orioles on Friday night.The Rays (55-50) were seven games out of the wild card with the same amount of games played last year but made a run and qualified for the playoffs on the final day of the season.

On it was a baseball, just a baseball, pulled from a carton, rubbed in mud, put in play and knocked for a double.Beyond that, Ford couldn\'t speak to the path it took to his locker, to how it was taken out of play, to its journey from the field and then the third-base dugout to this corner of this clubhouse in this summer of the Baltimore Orioles.View photos""Somebody,"" he said appreciatively. ""I don\'t know.""That baseball represented his 413th major-league hit, that Ford knew, and he could only assume it was the ball Ivan Nova threw and the one he hit deep into center field the night before. He grinned, somewhere between proud and bewildered, because maybe that ball never should have happened, but it did.""I\'m just a very realistic person,"" he said.Ford had gone 11 big-league at-bats between his 412th and 413th hits. Those at-bats were stretched over nearly five years, from the Metrodome in Minneapolis on Sept. 21, 2007, to Yankee Stadium on Tuesday night. They\'d waited out stops in Japan and Louisville and Mexico and Norfolk and parts of three summers on Long Island. They\'d persevered across bad hamstrings and hard decisions, through breathless goodbyes to his three children and past so many faces and ballparks he could hardly remember them all.[Also: Minor-league DJ ejected from game after playing \xe2\x80\x98Three Blind Mice\xe2\x80\x99]He kept thinking, One more season. Once, he\'d batted .299 over a full major-league season, hadn\'t he? Driven in 72 runs? Couldn\'t he still hit? Didn\'t he hit everywhere? Hadn\'t he always?""I thought I was still a good player,"" Ford said. ""I can\'t explain it.""All those years ago, he\'d walked on to the baseball team at Texas A&M as a freshman, been cut, and spent the year playing intramural softball instead. He\'d played at a couple junior colleges, one in Oklahoma, another in Texas, then walked on at Dallas Baptist University. He just kept showing up, trying out, fitting in, hitting. The Boston Red Sox drafted him 379th overall in 1999, and a year-and-a-half later traded him to the Twins for a relief pitcher.But, he\'d always believed. Through the Twins\' system, into the major leagues, and even when he washed out at 31 and had to go searching for a new way. Maybe it was injuries, maybe it was something else that put him there, but the next job would come, the next town, the next at-bat, and Lew Ford wouldn\'t quit. He had to play. He had to know.""This journey,"" Lew\'s father, Buck, said, ""it could have ended when he was 18 or 19.""Coming up on 36, balding, his body stronger again, Ford had committed to one final season, this one. He\'d return to the Long Island Ducks of the Independent Atlantic League for another summer of buses and ferries, but not for the long shot that one big-league scout might see him and remember him and think, you know, maybe. He\'d gotten to know those guys, the Ducks, and liked them. He\'d loved the community, the ballpark, the life. Together, they\'d lost in the playoffs the season before. So Ford was going back all right, to win a championship for the franchise, for manager Kevin Baez, and for teammates who\'d endured like him. And, of course, for himself.""Then,"" he said, ""just move on after that.""View photosIt was the first exit plan of his life, at least as far as baseball went.""You know, you\'re out of the majors for one year, it\'s hard,"" he said. ""Five years out? I realized how difficult it was going to be. So I just enjoyed what I was doing.""Nineteen games in, wouldn\'t you know, the Orioles called. Their general manager, Dan Duquette, had drafted Ford for the Red Sox 13 years before. The Orioles\' manager in Triple-A Norfolk, Ron Johnson, coached in the Red Sox\'s low minors when Ford was there. In 62 games at Norfolk, Ford batted .331. Late last Saturday afternoon Ford was preparing for a game when Johnson leaned into the weight room at Harbor Park.""Hey,"" Johnson shouted, ""you want to fly or drive to Baltimore?""""What?"" Ford said.""They need to know right now.""""I guess I\'ll drive.""Over those 4\xc2\xbd hours on the road, he called his oldest son, Jake. He called his mom and dad. He called the guys back on the Ducks and the friends at the gym on Long Island who helped put his body back together.[Jeff Passan: Winners, losers and tweeners from MLB\'s trade deadline]On Sunday, Ford was batting fifth and playing left field at Camden Yards. The next night, he was at Yankee Stadium, batting sixth. And Tuesday night, with a few of those old Ducks teammates in the stands and a division race still alive and the place alive with baseball, Lew Ford got his 413th big-league hit, the one that was never supposed to come.""I must say,"" said Buck Ford, who watched the hit fall from Texas, ""and I\'ve told him this, it\'s inspiring. Even if he wasn\'t my son I\'d say so.""Buck said he\'d never tried to talk Lew out of it. He\'d never put his hand on Lew\'s shoulder, summoned a fatherly tone and said, Son, I think it\'s time to come home. Never even thought it.""They have that thing called denial,"" Buck said with a small laugh. ""I probably had been in denial. I\'ve just seen him as a baseball player for so long, I guess I\'ve been in denial about not envisioning him as a baseball player.""And then there Lew was, dressed as a big leaguer, in that cathedral in the Bronx, throwin\' the bat head like always.""There\'s a universal truth in all of this that people can identify with,"" Buck said. ""You read in literature or see in the movies, the theme is somebody having a dream and into that they channel everything they have. So many times, they just can\'t reach it. But, the journey and the reward from it, that\'s from the passion. And Lew, he did it. That is what\'s so inspiring. Lew has done it.""For the moment, that might be a little big for Lew to consider. On a getaway day at Yankee Stadium that orange-and-black duffel was getting pretty full as it was. He\'s really got to go, to catch that bus, to see where it takes him. Maybe there\'s more baseball out there, and maybe not. Maybe ol\' Lew Ford was done a long time ago and he and Buck were just the last to know, and maybe not.""I don\'t want to think like that,"" Lew said. ""I can reflect on that when I\'m done playing.""He clarified, ""In the offseason.""[MLB Full Count: Watch live look-ins and highlights for free all season long]He grinned. Yeah, maybe he\'s got one more one last season to go.""I\'ve just loved this series so much,"" he said. ""I feel comfortable in there.

The catcher, Russell Martin, was set up on the inside corner of the plate against the right-handed Rivera, anticipating the typical splitter action: a sharp downward break, with perhaps a little tail toward the hitter.But this pitch, video replays confirm, forced Martin to move his glove about a foot to his right, away from the batter, at the last possible moment.The game continued without any mention of the pitch. But Mike Fast, then a writer for Baseball Prospectus who happened to be watching on television, noticed the bizarre movement and reached out to a friend, Alan Nathan, a physics professor at the University of Illinois. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Nathan had published numerous papers on the physics of baseball and pitching. But he, too, had never seen anything like what Garcia had done. This was not simply the Magnus effect \xe2\x80\x94 the principle responsible for the curve in a curveball.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  \xe2\x80\x9cThere was something else going on,\xe2\x80\x9d Nathan said. \xe2\x80\x9cThe left-right movement wasn\xe2\x80\x99t determined primarily by the spin; it was determined by something else.\xe2\x80\x9dOver the next months, Nathan analyzed frame-by-frame replays of the pitch to record its spin and looked at PitchF/X data to gather any clues about its movement.The conflict was this: A split-finger is usually gripped to reduce backspin on the ball because backspin prevents the ball from dropping. The typical Magnus effect on the ball will tilt it slightly in toward a hitter.

Cross performed several tests \xe2\x80\x94 often using polystyrene balls for better movement \xe2\x80\x94 and came up with what he views as a plausible theory. He published his findings in an article in the American Journal of Physics in January.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  What he theorized is termed the smooth patch effect. When air travels over a spinning baseball, its flow is disrupted by the raised and rough seams. That turbulence applies a force on the ball, causing it to break. Wherever the ball is smooth, however, or not covered by the seams, will cause it to go away from that direction.

He was the subject of trade rumors leading up to the non-waiver deadline with the Mariners last in the AL West.He\'ll look to become the first Seattle pitcher to win six straight starts since Joel Pineiro accomplished the feat from June 16-July 13, 2003.The left-hander\'s has lowered his ERA nearly a full run since it climbed to 4.66 after allowing 10 runs in a loss to Arizona on June 20.""To have a pitcher you can trust and count on to go out there and give your team a chance to win ballgames, that\'s everything,"" Wedge told the team\'s official website of Vargas.Vargas is 1-1 with a 1.69 ERA in five career starts against Baltimore, tossing nine shutout innings of Seattle\'s 2-1, 12-inning loss to the Orioles in his last outing May 12, 2011.Baltimore (57-51) is involved in a tight race for one of the league\'s two wild-card spots and helped its cause with a 1-0, 10-inning victory over Tampa Bay on Sunday that was also its second straight shutout.Taylor Teagarden, who had been mired in a 1-for-25 slump, hit an RBI double 10th as five pitchers combined on a three-hitter.The Orioles have won 10 straight one-run games and 11 consecutive extra-inning contests.\'\'Our guys did a lot of things well to make a difference in a real close game,\'\' manager Buck Showalter said. \'\'Well pitched on both sides.\'\'Baltimore, though, has scored only eight runs while splitting its last four games and also mustered only three hits Sunday.

The average baseball fan probably couldn\'t tell you much about Miguel Gonzalez. After all, he just made his major-league debut this season, two days after he turned 28 years old. He has spent years in the minors and in the Mexican League, and even most Orioles fans couldn\'t pick him out of a lineup (heck, the SB Nation player tagger doesn\'t even recognize him). But today, pedigree and fame played no part in the game. Gonzalez and Price dueled like two aces, putting up zero after zero on the scoreboard for their teams. And in the end, thanks to the gutsy effort by Gonzalez in a game when he was clearly the underdog, the Orioles prevailed. Both Price and Gonzalez had lapses with their control in the game as Price walked three batters, Gonzalez four. But they each only gave up two hits, which made for few situations for the other team to score. Gonzalez allowed more than one baserunner in just one inning, when he walked two batters in the fifth inning, which was closest the Rays came to a rally in the entire game. Otherwise they never had more than one batter on base in an inning, and Gonzalez was perfect twice. Price was even better: two Orioles reached base in the second inning but couldn\'t score. From the third through eighth innings, Price allowed just two more baserunners total, one on a single by Robert Andino in the third inning, and the other a walk by J.J. Hardy in the sixth.   With 104 pitches after seven innings, Gonzalez was finished. The walks probably kept him from being able to go out for another inning, but really, I couldn\'t ask much more of the guy. Great day for Gonzalez. He turned the game over the the Orioles reliable bullpen, and they delivered. Darren O\'Day pitched a perfect eighth, and after Troy Patton gave up a tough-luck single to Matt Joyce to start the ninth, Luis Ayala came in kept the Rays from capitalizing, his only baserunner coming on an intentional walk to Carlos Pena.    For the Rays, Fernando Rodney took over for Price in the ninth inning and didn\'t allow a run despite a leadoff walk to Andino.  But finally, in the tenth inning, a pitcher blinked. That pitcher was Joel Peralta. After recording a fly out from pinch hitter Nate McLouth, Peralta walked Mark Reynolds (at least Reynolds will still take a walk). That brought Omar Quintanilla to the plate and I hoped he\'d hit a home run so badly. Not only because it would give the Orioles a lead, but also because I could then make the headline to this story, ""Omar Comin\'."" or ""You come at the king, you best not miss."" Sadly, Omar struck out. With two outs, up came Taylor Teagarden, who of course introduced himself to Orioles fans with a walk-off home run on July 14th, his first game as an Oriole. Since then, unfortunately, he\'d gone 1-for-25, including his three earlier at bats in this game. Could he recapture that extra-inning magic? He could! With a 3-2 count, which thankfully meant Reynolds would be running on the pitch, Teagarden sent a ball to left-center field that rolled to the wall for a double. Reynolds came around to score the one and only run of the game. Well done, Taylor!    After that, all that was left was for Jim Johnson to do his thing, and he did it well. He needed only eight pitches against three Rays to get three outs and end the game. O\'s win! With that win, the Orioles went 4-2 on their road trip with series wins in both New York and Tampa Bay.

Chen\xe2\x80\x99s line: 7 IP, 5 H, 0 R, 1 BB, 4 K. On the other hand, the O\xe2\x80\x99s definitely seemed to finally catch a break in terms of an opponent\xe2\x80\x99s starter. How often have we seen this team go into games this year facing a team or a starting pitcher that\xe2\x80\x99s just recently started to heat up? I don\xe2\x80\x99t pay too much attention to that entire concept because it suggests that as a team you don\xe2\x80\x99t control your own destiny. If you look at every game and every series from the perspective of \xe2\x80\x9cthis team is hot or cold so we either don\xe2\x80\x99t stand a chance or we have a great shot,\xe2\x80\x9d \xc2\xa0you\xe2\x80\x99re saying that whatever your efforts are in a game will be pointless.That aside, Hellickson was off his game from the beginning, and the O\xe2\x80\x99s made him pay. Nick Markakis set the tone with a nine-pitch walk to lead off the game after being down 0-2 in the count early. That\xe2\x80\x99s exactly the type of at-bat you want to have to start things off; it put Hellickson on the defensive early, and he never really recovered. Markakis later went to second on Adam Jones\xe2\x80\x99 single, and then scored on an RBI-single by Matt Wieters. Speaking of which, Wieters proceeded to steal second base on an odd sequence where both Hellickson and catcher Javier Molina seemed to forget that he was on base. Just to show that he wasn\xe2\x80\x99t kidding around, Wieters decided to swipe a bag in the third as well. He was later thrown out at home plate, however he made his point.\xc2\xa0Note to Tampa: you do realize that Wieters runs like the Queen Mary, don\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xc2\xa0Nate McClouth made his Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 debut after his contract was purchased from triple-A Norfolk. (McClouth had a clause in his contract which stated that he could opt out of it on August 3rd if he was not called to the majors; the Orioles designated Endy Chavez for assignment as a corresponding roster move.) On the first pitch he saw McClouth doubled to right field, and later scored on Nick Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 RBI-single. Chris Davis followed suit in the fourth with the bases loaded as he sent the first pitch into center for a two-RBI single giving the O\xe2\x80\x99s a 4-0 lead which stood up for the rest of the game.Once you get a lead like that, it\xe2\x80\x99s up to your pitching to hold it. And hold it Wei-Yin Chen did! The few times he allowed runners past first base, he managed to pull out a huge strikeout or find a way to get the batter to fly out.

Throw in the fact that Oakland and New York both lost, and it was an all-around good day for the Orioles.You\xe2\x80\x99re only as good as your next day\xe2\x80\x99s starter, and given how Miguel Gonzalez has pitched this year the Orioles will probably have a bit of confidence coming into this afternoon\xe2\x80\x99s game. However Gonzalez was rocked around pretty badly by Tampa a couple of weeks ago, but rebounded in New York this past week.

Could be, however Jeremy Hellickson had been pretty good against the Orioles as well going into last night; if in fact for all things there is a season, perhaps now is a time\xc2\xa0for the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 luck against some of these Tampa starters to change!Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

Nova is certainly not the best in the world, especially after another dismal outing Monday. But a strong case could be made for the man who beat him.Justin Verlander, the reigning Cy Young Award winner and most valuable player in the American League, outshined Nova in every way at Comerica Park, even on a night when he was not necessarily at his best. But he was awfully good.Verlander matched his career high by striking out 14 in eight impressive innings, and he allowed only two unearned runs and eight hits as the Detroit Tigers beat the Yankees, 7-2. Verlander threw a season-high 132 pitches, and he looked in command right down to the final out, a nasty curveball that made Ichiro Suzuki look abnormally awkward.\xe2\x80\x9cA lot of times, great pitchers get nastier when there\xe2\x80\x99s men on base,\xe2\x80\x9d Derek Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey bear down a little, and he did that today.

On Saturday, the Seattle Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 Felix Hernandez tossed a two-hit shutout at Yankee Stadium.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  But the greater concern is Nova, whose struggles continue.Without the crisp slider that made him a consistent winner, if not the best pitcher in the world, Nova has allowed 16 runs and 21 hits in 101/3 innings over his past two starts. In his previous start, he surrendered a season-high 9 runs and 10 hits in five innings of a loss to the Baltimore Orioles, and on Monday he gave up 7 runs and 11 hits, which tied his season high.This time, there was no talk of lost focus or lucky hits by the Orioles, just a simple, cold analysis.

New Oriole Wei-Yin Chen has been great for the Orioles this season, easily their best starting pitcher when you take into account Jason Hammel's injury. And as much as I've enjoyed watching him pitch, I've enjoyed seeing the pride exhibited for him in stadiums around baseball as he represents Taiwan, just one of eight players from there in the history of baseball. On Thursday, August 9th, the Orioles will give out 10,000 of the t-shirts shown above, with Orioles on the front and Chen on the back written in Mandarin Chinese. To make things even better, Chen is scheduled to be the starting pitcher on Thursday. From the press release from the Orioles:  Chen is scheduled to start Thursday, subject to change.

08/07/2012,"[(""Orioles' Thome, Hammel out until September"", ""The injury updates were aplenty for the Baltimore Orioles on Monday, and none of them were all that encouraging.  Jim Thome and Jason Hammel aren't expected back until September -- meaning the club will need more starts like Chris Tillman's outing Monday, and more homers from guys like Nick Markakis.  Thome said Monday that he may be sidelined for longer, as he'll go the next 30 days without baseball activity. He is attempting to overcome a herniated neck disk.  Hammel may be back on a mound within two weeks. For now, he's just working on throwing on flat ground as he comes back from arthroscopic knee surgery performed July 16.  In other medical news, Nick Johnson remains on the 60-day disabled list with a wrist injury that hasn't shown much improvement. There is a chance that the veteran may not return this season.  As for right-hander Stu Pomeranz, he was scheduled to work out Monday in Sarasota, Fla., but he didn't throw because of discomfort in his leg related to a back injury, MASNsports.com reported. Pomeranz went on the disabled list in late May due to a pulled side muscle.  The return of any of the veterans would be viewed by the Orioles like a late-season trade acquisition. In the meantime, the remaining crew scored three runs in the second inning Monday and held on for a 3-1 win over the Seattle Mariners.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Once Chris Tillman got through the first inning, it became apparent the right-hander was going to be tough on the Seattle Mariners.And that is precisely what happened.Tillman took a three-hit shutout into the eighth inning to extend a run of successful starts by Baltimore pitchers, and the Orioles beat Jason Vargas and the Mariners 3-1 on Monday night.In his first five starts since being recalled from Triple-A Norfolk on July 4, Tillman gave up 13 first-inning runs. He broke the pattern in this one, putting the Mariners down in order on 12 pitches.''It was big,'' Tillman said. ''I went out with the mindset of one inning at a time. (The first inning) has been kind of a downfall for me, but I knew what I needed to do to get through it and I made some pitches.''Tillman (5-1) gave up one run, five hits and a walk in 7 1-3 innings to win his fourth straight start and lower his ERA to a sparkling 2.38. After jockeying between the minors and majors since 2009, Tillman seems poised to stick with Baltimore.''It feels good,'' he said. ''I feel like I put a lot of work in in the offseason and carried it into the season and spring training and what not. I feel like it's starting to pay off here, and we're not done. We have a long way to go. We've got a lot of season left and we've got to keep working until we're done.''Nick Markakis homered and Mark Reynolds had three hits and an RBI for the Orioles, who have won six of eight to improve to 58-51. Baltimore didn't record its 58th win last year until Sept. 9, one day after its 85th defeat.This season, it's all about pitching. The Mariners scored in the eighth to end a streak of 28 scoreless innings by Baltimore pitchers; over the past four games, Orioles starters have given up two runs over 27 innings.Tillman certainly did his part.''His fastball had good life up in the zone,'' Seattle's Eric Thames said. ''He had a good changeup. All of his stuff was pretty much on today. Whenever we were sitting on counts, he threw the opposite pitch. It was just one of those days.''Pedro Strop got two outs in the eighth and Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 33rd save in 36 tries.Vargas (12-8) allowed three runs - all in the second inning. Seeking to become the first Seattle pitcher in nine years to win six consecutive starts, Vargas yielded eight hits, struck out two and walked none in going the distance.''It says a great deal about him and how far he's come,'' manager Eric Wedge said. ''He had earned the right to stay out there. I wanted him to be out there. I trust him.''Munenori Kawasaki drove in the lone run for the last-place Mariners, who have lost three of four following a seven-game winning streak.After stranding runners at second and third in the first inning, the Orioles went up 3-0 in the second. Lew Ford singled and scored on a double by Reynolds before Markakis drove a 1-2 pitch over the scoreboard in right field, the first homer allowed by Vargas in four starts since July 16.Tillman held the Mariners hitless until the fifth, when Mike Carp hit a sharp grounder where shortstop J.J. Hardy would have been positioned had the Orioles not been in a shift to provide extra coverage to the right side of the infield.In the Seattle sixth, Kawasaki reached on a bunt and advanced to third with one out but was stranded.The Mariners finally broke through in the eighth.

Let's get this over.' They grind it,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''They put in so much effort.''Matt Wieters homered twice, J.J. Hardy contributed a pivotal three-run drive and Nick Markakis had four hits for the Orioles, who trailed 5-0 in the second inning and 7-2 in the sixth.Once the game got past the ninth, it was Baltimore's time.Asked to explain the phenomenon, Wieters said, ''I don't know if anybody can give you an exact answer other than (we) just keep playing. There is no quit in this team. We know with our bullpen, they keep putting up zeros and eventually somebody's got to score.''It happened in the 14th, when the Orioles put an end to a marathon that lasted 5 minutes short of five hours.Omar Quintanilla led off against Shawn Kelley (2-3) by hitting a grounder to second baseman Dustin Ackley, who made a great stop before throwing to first baseman Mike Carp. Umpire Brian Knight ruled Carp took his foot off the bag while stretching for the throw, and Mariners manager Eric Wedge was ejected for arguing the call.Markakis followed with a single, Hardy sacrificed and an intentional walk loaded the bases. Jones then hit an opposite-field liner to right that glanced off the glove of Casper Wells, allowing Quintanilla to score.Afterward, Wedge and Carp were still fuming.''He was out,'' Wedge said. ''He didn't even come close to coming off the bag. It was evident that he was on there, and noticeably so, and it's just a shame that he has to make that call right there and cost us the ballgame.''Carp added: ''I've got nothing to say that's worth saying. You guys saw it, the whole world saw it. I hope someone has the decency to say something about it.''Darren O'Day (6-0), the seventh Baltimore pitcher, worked two innings.It was the fourth straight victory for the Orioles, who moved eight games over .500 (59-51) for the first time since June 29. Baltimore has won 11 straight one-run games.Kyle Seager and Miguel Olivo homered for the Mariners, who have lost four of five following a seven-game winning streak. Seattle finished with 18 hits but did not score after the sixth inning.''The bullpen was the difference,'' Showalter said.Wieters launched Baltimore's comeback with his second homer of the night, a sixth-inning drive that made it 7-3.Mark Reynolds chased starter Blake Beavan in the seventh with a leadoff double, and Lucas Luetge promptly gave up an RBI single to Quintanilla. Markakis followed with an infield hit before Hardy sent an 0-1 pitch into the left-field seats to erase a lead the Mariners held from the top of the first.That ruined Beavan's bid to win a fifth straight start, a streak that began with his recall from Triple-A Tacoma on July 17.Orioles starter Zach Britton gave up seven runs, four earned, and eight hits in five-plus innings. Despite the poor pitching line, the left-hander lowered his ERA to 8.10.After the game, he was sent down to the minors.The Mariners jumped in front with three unearned runs in the first. After Britton fumbled a dribbler by Ackley, Jesus Montero was credited with a two-out hit when Wilson Betemit couldn't handle his hard grounder to third. Seager followed with his team-high 12th home run, the first in 19 games since July 18.Seattle made it 5-0 in the second. After Olivo hit a solo homer, three straight singles - the last by Trayvon Robinson - produced another run.In the bottom half, Wieters homered on a 3-2 pitch and Markakis added a two-out RBI single.The Mariners went up 7-2 in the sixth when Wells tripled and scored on a single by Carp, who came home on a single by Ackley.NOTES: The Orioles optioned Britton to Triple-A Norfolk and recalled RHP Steve Johnson, who will start Wednesday night.

He will be making his major league debut. Machado, 20, has batted .266/.352/.438 with 11 home runs and 59 RBI in 109 games with the Baysox this season, including a .275/.365/.505 line in 91 at-bats since the All-Star break. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 first round selection (#3 overall) in the 2010 First Year Player Draft out of Brito Private School in Miami, FL, Machado came into 2012 rated as the #2 prospect in the Orioles organization and the #11 prospect overall by Baseball America.  He played in the MLB Futures Game in Kansas City in July, going 1-for-3 with a double, two RBI and a run scored. Machado was a 2011 South Atlantic League All-Star.               Machado entered play on Wednesday a career .263/.343/.428 hitter in 218 minor league games over three seasons (2010-2012).  Talk about a surprise move. There was nothing to telegraph this at all. Who knows why it\'s being done right at this point in time? None of us know, and it seems neither did the reporters when the announcement was made. It\'s even more curious because the beat writers have tweeted that he\'s ""not definitely starting"", but he might, though. The other tidbit is that while they will plan to use him as a 3B in the interim, they see him as a shortstop long term. That last comes from Kevin Goldstein, who is a must-follow - just accept the occasional non-baseball weirdness (which is really part of the fun). Obviously, it\'s the 3B position where the O\'s have a bit of difficulty right now, with players who either can\'t hit or can\'t field. Machado can do both - or, well, that is his ceiling. He is probably not there yet, but that batting line in the press release above probably tells the tale. Could be a hot streak, could be that the Orioles feel like he\'s made that last adjustment to get him ready to be a big league player - or at least a better big league player at third base than the Orioles are currently getting from the platoon of Wilson Betemit and Robert Andino. We have been watching what the O\'s have been getting from said platoon. That\'s not a high bar to clear. Machado turned 20 in July. Is this a panic move? That\'s the big question. We know how the O\'s panic moves with young pitchers went in the Andy MacPhail era. It\'s Dan Duquette\'s time now, and his people, by calling up Machado, say he\'s our best bet.    Duquette\'s the mad genius whose plan has gotten the team this far. No reason to stop trusting him just yet. Whether it\'ll work or not is another story entirely, but it\'s certainly a bold move - and it\'s not completely insane to think that Machado will make some noise for himself, if not quite as much noise as 19-year-old Bryce Harper or 21-year-old Mike Trout. Strap yourselves in, ladies and gentlemen, and do whatever you feel you must do to celebrate the imminent arrival of Machadomas. There was already going to be a Camden Chat gathering at the game for Wei-Yin Chen t-shirt night - and I think it\'s about to get a bit bigger than it was already.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"
08/09/2012,"[('Royals-Orioles Preview - yahoo.com', 'A young and talented roster is looking to lead the Baltimore Orioles to their first playoff appearance since 1997, when the latest addition to the team was only 5 years old.Manny Machado, Baltimore\'s top prospect, is expected to make his major league debut Thursday night when the Orioles go for a season-high sixth straight win in the opener of a four-game series against the Kansas City Royals.The third overall selection in the 2010 draft behind Bryce Harper and Jameson Taillon, the 20-year-old Machado has been playing with Double-A Bowie this season.He\'s batting .266 with 11 homers and 59 RBIs in 109 games, mostly at shortstop, but the Orioles figure to use him at third base in the midst of their unlikely postseason push.""The guy\'s got a lot of talent, and we feel like he can help,"" executive vice president of baseball operations Dan Duquette told the Orioles\' official website. ""Manny should be a plus defender, wherever we play him. He\'s a five-tool player, and he can help our team.""Another youngster came up big Wednesday as Steve Johnson went six innings and struck out nine to win his first major league start. Baltimore (60-51) beat Seattle 9-2 for its fifth straight win overall, matching the club\'s longest run of the season.Nick Markakis went 8 for 16 with two homers and five RBIs in the three-game sweep of the Mariners, while Matt Wieters drove in five runs Wednesday alone after homering twice Tuesday.Johnson\'s strong outing was the fourth time during the win streak that a Baltimore starter went at least six innings while giving up two runs or fewer.Wei-Yin Chen (10-6, 3.46 ERA) is a good candidate to extend that success after giving up five hits - all singles - in seven innings of a 4-0 win Saturday at Tampa Bay.The rookie left-hander is 3-1 with a 1.95 ERA in five starts since the All-Star break. He hasn\'t allowed an earned run over his last two outings, striking out 16 in 12 2-3 innings.""He\'s got a good understanding of what\'s going on up here at this level right now, and we hope to ride it,"" manager Buck Showalter said.Chen didn\'t receive a decision against the Royals on May 26 despite a sharp performance. He gave up two runs in six innings of Baltimore\'s 4-3 home loss.Kansas City (47-63) took two of three in that series and did the same while visiting the first-place Chicago White Sox this week. Wednesday\'s 2-1 victory was the Royals\' sixth win in nine games overall.Following strong pitching performances by Bruce Chen and Jeremy Guthrie the last two days, the Royals will hand the ball to rookie Will Smith (2-4, 6.00), who makes his first appearance against the Orioles.The left-hander is 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA in his last three road starts, but he gave up four runs and eight hits while walking three in 5 2-3 innings of a 4-2 home loss to Texas on Saturday.""I feel a little step-by-step process,"" Smith told the Royals\' official website. ""Each day I go with a little something to work on out there and it just keeps coming.""The homers keep coming for Kansas City\'s Billy Butler, who went deep twice earlier this season in Baltimore - once off Wei-Yin Chen - and hit two more homers this week in Chicago to give him a career-high 22. Butler is 8 for 19 against the Orioles this year.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Buck Showalter counted himself among the many fans at Camden Yards pulling for Steve Johnson to excel in his first major league start.Watching Johnson from the Orioles dugout, Showalter allowed himself to play the role of a baseball enthusiast while the rookie struck out nine Seattle Mariners during Baltimore's 9-2 victory Wednesday night.''Stevie was good, huh? That was fun to watch,'' Showalter said. ''I tried to watch it as a manager trying to win a game but also a fan of those type of situations. We really wanted Steve to have success tonight, for him and for the club.''Johnson (1-0) gave up two runs, five hits and two walks over six innings in his second big-league appearance. The 24-year-old was recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to sub for Tommy Hunter, who was scratched because he threw in the bullpen Tuesday night in anticipation of entering a game that lasted 14 innings.Johnson grew up in Baltimore and is the son of former Orioles pitcher Dave Johnson, who now works for the team's TV network. Steve Johnson's debut as a starter came exactly 23 years after his father made his first career start in Baltimore, a complete-game win against Minnesota.Although the younger Johnson didn't go the distance, the right-hander made the most of his 97 pitches.''It was great and it was unbelievable. Words really can't explain,'' Steve Johnson said. ''I know a lot of people texted me and said they were coming. A lot of people from my high school and people I went to high school with. It was great.''To cap it off, he shared an emotional moment with his father after the game.''It's something I was thinking about for a long time - get my first win and have him here,'' Johnson said. ''And the way those days worked out, 23 years to the day, it's just special. It's all I can really say about it. It means a lot to me.''Matt Wieters volunteered to catch the rookie, one night after stooping behind the plate for all 14 innings. In addition to serving as a calming influence while Johnson was on the mound, Wieters tied a career high with five RBIs to help Baltimore complete a three-game sweep.Nick Markakis and Mark Reynolds homered, and Adam Jones had three hits for the Orioles, who have won five straight and eight of 10. It was Baltimore's 60th victory of the season, compared to 69 all last year.The Orioles built a 7-0 lead by the fourth inning against former teammate Kevin Millwood (4-10) and cruised to the finish in their sixth sweep of 2012.Johnson blanked Seattle on three hits through five innings before giving up a two-run homer to Kyle Seager in the sixth.It was Seager's team-high 13th homer, the second in two nights. He finished with three hits in the Mariners' fourth straight defeat, a skid that began at Yankee Stadium.''Tonight is the first night we didn't play well. We played well in New York and last night was a battle,'' manager Eric Wedge said. ''We're working through some things here. We have a couple of new guys, and we have to take an opportunity to see what they can and cannot do.''Johnson needed only six pitches to strike out the first two batters in the first inning, then went to 0-2 on Jesus Montero before giving up a single. Johnson followed that with a three-pitch strikeout of cleanup hitter John Jaso.Baltimore went up 2-0 in the bottom half. With two on and two outs, Wieters hit a liner to right that sent Eric Thames running toward the wall. As he leaped to make the catch, the ball popped out of his glove for a two-run double.Seattle used a single and two walks to load the bases with one out in the second, but Johnson worked out of trouble.The Orioles made it 4-0 in the third. Markakis led off with a triple and scored on a single by J.J. Hardy, who took third on a double by Jones and came home on a groundout by Wieters.In the fourth, Reynolds hit a solo shot, Omar Quintanilla singled and Markakis drove a 1-2 pitch over the right-field wall. Millwood got the final two outs but did not return for the fifth.''I didn't pitch very good today,'' said Millwood, who gave up two homers in a game for the first time this season. ''No fun to stink. We didn't play well here at all.''Millwood pitched for Baltimore in 2010, going 4-16 with a 5.10 ERA in 31 starts.Wieters hit a two-run double in the seventh off Josh Kinney.NOTES: The Orioles placed INF Ryan Flaherty on the 15-day DL with a bacterial infection and recalled RHP Miguel Socolovich to strengthen the bullpen after Tuesday night's marathon. ... Seattle has a day off Thursday and will face the Los Angeles Angels on the road Friday. Baltimore opens a three-game series against the Kansas City Royals on Thursday night. ... Seattle's Michael Saunders went 0 for 14 with seven strikeouts in the series. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('The Orioles are winning, attendance is up, but challenges ...', ' There\'s not much that\'s more fun than being at Oriole Park at Camden Yards when the stadium is packed, the Orioles are winning and the crowd is rocking. Such sights and sounds have been few and far between in recent years, with the stadium only selling out for a few marquee days like Opening Day and maybe weekend series\' against Boston and New York. With the Orioles having been a bad baseball team for nearly a decade and a half, even when the stadium does fill, the O\'s have tended not to win, and those teams\' fanbases have been gloating and rubbing in their success.Many people, including myself, have written that when the team starts winning, the stadium will start to fill up again. While the Orioles\' attendance is up by an average of nearly 5,000 fans per game over last year, which is great, this still doesn\'t tell the whole story, because there\'s the old question of the Tuesday mid-week series against a crappy team. This was in evidence last night, with a paid attendance of 15,433 there to witness the comeback and extra-innings drama against the Mariners. As recently as 2001, the O\'s were drawing over 3 million fans a year. A few years later, in the 2005 season that started off so promising, the O\'s were still averaging over 30,000 fans per home game, and they have been below 2 million in attendance since 2008. Not much of a surprise that attendance has declined over 14 straight losing seasons. People have found other things to do with their time and money, and why shouldn\'t they have? Fandom is not a suicide pact. The Orioles have done very little over that stretch of time to engender the kind of weird dedication that the Chicago Cubs maintain even when they are terrible - that team, for instance, is on pace to top 3 million fans while winning 64 games. Attendance being up by nearly 5,000 fans a game is an extra 400,000 over the course of the season. That\'s not a bad rebound for a suddenly-contending team with a fanbase skeptical that things could really improve. Yet this isn\'t enough for some. Across the blogosphere and talk radio circuit, and even occasionally in the mainstream media, there\'s condemnation of fans. ""You wanted to see a winner,"" they say, ""and now there\'s a winner, so why aren\'t you at the Yard?"" ""Pack the Yard!"" shout some. ""Take the oath!"" say others. (I love the Orioles, but oath, really?) A number, though not all, of the people saying these things have paychecks signed in one way or another by Peter Angelos, though I\'ve seen at least one person who, while repeatedly swearing that Angelos will never receive another dime, wonders why fans aren\'t showing up.    Why is the blame on the fans here? If you\'re the Orioles, you can\'t just say, ""Here\'s a winning baseball team - now show up, you ingrates, and count yourselves fortunate you get to."" (That would be the Yankees or Red Sox message.)    The landscape has changed since the last time the Orioles had a full winning season. Baltimore isn\'t a one-sport town any more. The Ravens are here, and like it or not, they\'ve been successful over the past decade and the Orioles haven\'t. They get the ink, the air time, and the pixels of local sports media. Like it or not (and I sure don\'t), the Nationals have set up shop not far away as well and have sucked some fans from the outer orbits of the Orioles territory into their own place. A professor of mine would always say, ""The challenge is in reaching an audience that is increasingly fragmented and diverse."" He was talking about media in politics, but it\'s the same challenge for a sports team that\'s struggled for over a decade. People are doing other things with their lives. They are busy. They may have more demanding jobs. They have their routine they are settled in. The Orioles have fallen into the periphery and these folks need a nudge beyond just winning baseball to come to the stadium - or show up more often each season.    A fine example of this is my own family. My folks want to find a game where we all (including my sister and I) can take my grandmother to an O\'s game. Juggling everyone\'s work schedules and social lives against the O\'s schedule of home dates leaves exactly one day in August where we can all go to the game and not have anyone left out. Had the Orioles been good for a long time, perhaps they move up in people\'s social schedules, but why should we expect this to have changed after four winning months against fourteen losing years? Another thing to consider is that going to a baseball game costs some money, and we are still in uncertain economic times. If a family of four wants to think about going to the game, you\'re probably looking at a bare minimum of $100, if you can get the cheapest tickets and limit yourselves to $10 a person for food and drink - which you probably can\'t. So going to an O\'s game is a specially budgeted item, probably. This demographic can\'t just wake up one morning and decide to go to an Orioles game. Compound these issues with cost and logistics and it\'s not much wonder that attendance has increased, but not as fast as some people would like. Four months of winning baseball is worth 5,000 fans per game so far, which is great, even if it still leaves you in a sparse crowd of 15,000 as the O\'s take on Seattle on a Tuesday night and try to keep chasing down the Yankees. That\'s not enough for some to stop the criticism. Really, it shouldn\'t be enough for the Orioles. However, rather than blame the people who aren\'t showing up, why not put some of the burden on the Orioles to give these people a reason to show up? Next time, I\'ll be tackling some of the ways that I think the O\'s could be harnessing social media, and more traditional promotions, to lure more fans out to the ballpark.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Billy Butler had already cleared the most difficult obstacles of hitting for the cycle, including a home run and his first triple since 2009.All he needed was a measly little single in his final two at-bats to become the seventh player in the history of the Kansas City Royals to complete the cycle.Butler fell short, but that was one of very few negatives for the Royals in an 8-2 win over the Baltimore Orioles on Thursday night.Butler finished with three RBIs and scored three runs, and Alex Gordon homered and had three hits to help Kansas City end the Orioles' five-game winning streak and take the luster off Manny Machado's impressive major league debut.Butler homered in a four-run first inning, doubled in the third and tripled in the fifth. Vying to become the first Kansas City player to hit for the cycle since George Brett in 1990, Butler struck out against Matt Lindstrom in the seventh and submariner Darren O'Day in the ninth.''I really didn't have much to hit,'' Butler said. ''They pitched me tough with some really good sliders. O'Day is not somebody a right-hander is going to have much success against at all. I know I haven't in my history. I'm just trying to take him the other way and it just didn't work out. He's going to get most righties out all of the time.''Butler is 11 for 24 (.458) with three homers and five RBIs in six games against Baltimore this season.''Butler's one of the top five right-handed hitters in baseball,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.

We made some good pitches on him the last couple at-bats, but we made some mistakes on him and good hitters are going to pounce on those.''Machado, the third overall pick in the 2010 draft, went 2 for 4 and played flawlessly at third base in his first game above the Double-A level. The 20-year-old grounded out in the second inning, tripled in the fifth, beat out a slow roller to second base in the seventh and popped out to end the game.''I thought Manny did well, presented himself well tonight,'' Showalter said. ''I'm proud of him. There was a nice calmness about him and a good start. He handled the situation well, all things considered.''Machado was pleased with his performance but disappointed with the final score.''It would have been way much better if we would have come out with a win, but they did a good job,'' the rookie said.Asked if this taste of success might carry over, Machado replied, ''I've still got a long year and a lot more at-bats to go. But for the first night I think it went great.''Matt Wieters homered for the Orioles, who failed for a sixth time this season to extend a five-game winning streak to six.Baltimore rookie Wei-Yin Chen (10-7) allowed a career-high seven runs and nine hits in 4 2-3 innings. Coming off two straight starts in which he did not allow an earned run, the Taiwanese left-hander yielded a home run to Gordon on the second pitch of the game and never got back on track.Will Smith (3-4) gave up two runs and six hits in seven innings for the Royals, who have won four of five.''That was a great game,'' manager Ned Yost said. ''We tacked on runs on three or four different occasions. (Alcides) Escobar was spectacular at shortstop. Great defense. We hit homers. We hit doubles. We played very, very well.''Kansas City took a 4-0 lead before Chen could get an out. After Gordon hit his third leadoff homer of the season, Escobar and Lorenzo Cain followed with singles before Butler homered on a 1-1 pitch.In the second inning, Machado received a warm ovation from the crowd of 21,226 before his first at-bat. With two on and two outs, he hit a chopper to Escobar and was thrown out by a step.The Royals used doubles by Butler, Mike Moustakas and Jeff Francoeur to make it 6-0 in the third. Moustakas was 2 for 27 lifetime against Baltimore before his run-scoring hit.Chen's night ended in the fifth, when Butler tripled and scored on a sacrifice fly by Salvador Perez.In the bottom half, Machado tripled and scored on a fly ball by Nick Markakis to make it 7-1. Escobar hit an RBI single in the sixth, and Wieters connected in the Orioles' half.NOTES: To make room for Machado, the Orioles optioned RHP Steve Johnson to Triple-A Norfolk.

(AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- When Manny Machado arrived at Camden Yards amid much fanfare, Orioles manager Buck Showalter insisted the 20-year-old player was promoted for no other reason than to help the team win.And that is precisely what Machado did in his second game in the major leagues.Machado thrust himself into the Orioles' record book by hitting two home runs and driving in four runs, a power display that carried Baltimore past the Kansas City Royals 7-1 on Friday night.After going 2 for 4 in his debut on Thursday, Machado hit a solo shot in the fifth inning and a three-run drive in the sixth. Both homers came off Luke Hochevar (7-10) and landed in the left-field seats.The second clinched the victory, but Machado will never forget his first home run trot in the big leagues.''It was the best feeling ever,'' he said. ''The crowd here loves me, and for them to support me like that, after my first home run, it just felt great.''After the second one, Machado was pushed out the dugout by teammate Adam Jones to acknowledge the request of a curtain call by the crowd of 17,277.''It was great,'' Machado said. ''I've dreamed about that my whole life, about going out there and getting that curtain call, and second game in the big leagues I get it.''At 20 years and 35 days old, Machado is the youngest Oriole ever to have a multihomer game. Boog Powell was 20 years and 258 days old when he homered twice against Minnesota in May 1962.Machado also became the 12th youngest major leaguer since 1918 to hit at least two home runs in a game.Machado, the third overall pick in the 2010 draft, went 2 for 4 in his second straight start at third base. He had never played above the Double-A level before Thursday night.And that explains why manager Buck Showalter was cautious in his praise of the youngster.''It's two games. He's off to a good start,'' Showalter said. ''He's hit some mistakes and hit them well, which guys have to do up here. He'll have the kitchen sink thrown at him and we'll see how it goes. But so far, so good.''Omar Quintanilla also homered for the Orioles, who have won six of seven.Miguel Gonzalez (4-2) allowed one run and six hits in eight innings, striking out five and walking one. The right-hander was 0-2 with a 10.80 ERA in two home starts.Salvador Perez homered for the Royals, who lost for the second time in six games. Hochevar had allowed only 13 homers in 22 starts before giving up three in this one.''That's what it falls on: three mistakes that they didn't miss,'' said Hochevar, who went 5 1-3 innings. ''Hitters don't usually miss mistakes at this level.''Not even Machado in his second game.''These last two games he's played really well. He's hit mistakes, he's hit good pitches,'' Hochevar said. ''He's having some really, really good at-bats. Plays good defense and obviously swinging it well right now.''Baltimore led 2-1 before Machado notched his first home run and RBI with one swing at a 3-2 pitch. In the sixth, after Nate McLouth doubled in a run, Machado connected on a 1-2 pitch for a 7-1 lead.Machado's heroics overshadowed a fine performance by another Baltimore rookie, Gonzalez, who went eight innings for the first time.''Just throwing strikes, getting ahead of guys,'' Gonzalez said. ''My sinker worked well and my changeup was good.''In his previous two starts at home, Gonzalez twice gave up a home run to the first batter he faced and yielded a combined six first-inning runs. He reversed that trend by striking out leadoff hitter Alex Gordon to begin a 1-2-3 first.Perez hit a drive over the right-field wall in the second inning to put the Royals up 1-0. It was the 10th homer allowed by Gonzalez in 48 2-3 innings, although nine of those 10 home runs have been solo shots.In the bottom half, Wilson Betemit led off with a double, and Quintanilla homered with two outs.NOTES: The same fan ended up with both of Machado's home-run ball. Adam Corder traded the first ball for several signed baseballs and a bat. He opted to keep the second ball. ... Royals CF Jarrod Dyson left in the eighth inning with a twisted left ankle. ... Orioles LHP Chris Tillman (5-1, 2.38 ERA) pitches Saturday in the third game of the series. KC will start Luis Mendoza (5-8, 4.36), who hasn't faced Baltimore since 2008 with Texas. ...

Quintanilla had three hits to up his batting average to .333. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: Manny being Manny - birdswatcher.com', 'I\xe2\x80\x99ll admit that when the Orioles first said they were calling up Manny Machado I had my doubts. I thought that training a rookie third baseman (who\xe2\x80\x99s natural position is actually shortstop) in the middle of a pennant race was a bad idea. Furthermore, it started the big league service clock on Machado; if they were going to bring him up they should have waited until next May. However what I discounted was that it was possible that Machado was ready to come up. Two home runs later, it looks like that might have been the case. Machado hit his first big league home run in the fifth, and then followed that up with his second in the sixth.\xc2\xa0So\xe2\x80\xa6it looks like I was wrong. I\xe2\x80\x99ll give credit to Dan Duquette and Buck Showalter; common sense dictated that this was not the time to bring up a prospect like Machado, however they went with their gut feeling. Granted he\xe2\x80\x99s still only played two games, however the early returns are very promising. Seeing a prospect of his caliber smack his first and second career homers back-to-back was one of the most exciting things to happen at the yard in years (although it probably doesn\xe2\x80\x99t compare with game 162 of last year).Kansas City took an early 1-0 lead on a Perez solo homer, however that was short lived. With Wilson Betemit at second, Omar Quintanilla smacked a homer to right field, giving the Orioles a 2-1 lead. Quintanilla\xe2\x80\x99s another guy that\xe2\x80\x99s very quietly made his presence known since coming to the Orioles. He swings a good bat and he\xe2\x80\x99s a good glove man at second. Starting pitcher Miguel Gonzalez settled down after the early homer, and gave the O\xe2\x80\x99s eight extremely solid innings. Gonzalez\xe2\x80\x99s line: 8 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 5 K. It\xe2\x80\x99s worth pointing out that when Gonzalez first came up from the minors he was a bullpen reliever. The fact that he\xe2\x80\x99s turned into such a solid starter and is able to go so deep into games is a valuable thing for the Orioles. Keep in mind also that the O\xe2\x80\x99s still might have been feeling the affects of a 14-inning game Tuesday combined with a long outing by the \xe2\x80\x98pen on Thursday night. So the fact that Gonzalez was able to go so deep into the game last night bought some extra rest for quite a few arms last night.Obviously the story of the night was Manny Machado. He became the youngest Oriole to hit his first big league homer since another 19-year old did it in 1965. Ironically, that guy was in the ballpark last night, right up in the MASN TV booth: Jim Palmer. We also saw something out of Machado that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t seen out of an Oriole in quite some time. After the first homer the fans huddled around the dugout wanted Machado to come out for a curtain call, but it never happened. After the second time the calls became too much, and he came out of the dugout and tipped his cap. That\xe2\x80\x99s something that Oriole fans have seen out of so many opposing players over the years, and furthermore they\xe2\x80\x99ve seemed so comfortable doing it. (Machado only did it after the second home run, and it was obvious that he didn\xe2\x80\x99t want to come out of the dugout because it might take away from the game.) I\xe2\x80\x99m quite sure that another guy named Manny probably even took curtain calls in front of \xe2\x80\x9chis fans\xe2\x80\x9d as a player for a division rival at Camden Yards in the past. But it\xe2\x80\x99s been awhile since an Oriole has done that; the times they are a-changin\xe2\x80\x99!Tonight is a special night at Camden Yards, as we\xe2\x80\x99ll see the unveiling of the Eddie Murray statue in left field. The ballpark gates open at 5 PM, and the ceremony starts at 5:15; all fans in attendance will receive a miniature replica of the Murray statue. I\xe2\x80\x99m sure that Mother Goose could do up a decent nursery rhyme about Murray\xe2\x80\x99s career \xe2\x80\x93 no, wait \xe2\x80\x93 a fairy tail is probably more like it! \xe2\x80\x9cSteady Eddie\xe2\x80\x9d is, in my opinion, the best first baseman in Oriole history. (My old man would argue Jim Gentile, however that\xe2\x80\x99s a generational discussion I guess!) However perhaps more importantly Murray symbolizes the old Oriole Way, which takes us back to the magical times of yesteryear. Incidentally, these statues are being unveiled right as the magic begins to return.After the Murray statue is unveiled the Orioles will send Chris Tillman to the mound in hopes that he continues his own magic that we\xe2\x80\x99ve seen thus far. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by Luis Mendoza, who was fairly solid in his last outing however he was left in one inning too long. It\xe2\x80\x99s easy enough to say that this is a big game for the Orioles, but that will go without saying for the rest of the way this year. They\xe2\x80\x99re all big games; that\xe2\x80\x99s how it goes in a pennant race.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles Pitcher Steve Johnson \\xab CBS Baltimore', ' Steve Johnson, starting pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, joined the show to talk about his first career win with the team.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Manny Machado might want to brush up on his knowledge of Baltimore Orioles history, because the rookie continues to put his name alongside several of the team's finest players in the franchise record book.Machado hit his third homer in four major league games, Nick Markakis also connected, and Baltimore got four hitless innings from its bullpen in a 5-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals on Sunday.Mark Reynolds drove in the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning for the Orioles, who earned a split of the four-game series.Machado hit a two-run homer in the second off former Baltimore pitcher Bruce Chen (8-10). The 20-year-old tripled in his debut Thursday night, homered twice in his second game and doubled in a run Saturday night.On Friday night, Machado became the youngest Oriole to have multihomer game, breaking the mark set previously by Boog Powell. With his drive on Sunday, Machado joined Frank Robinson, Ray Knight and Lee May as the only players to get an extra-base hit in each of their first four games with the Orioles.''That's crazy. That's the first time I heard it,'' Machado said. ''To be mentioned with Frank Robinson, one of the greatest third basemen, that's just great. It's a great feeling. I'm just fortunate.''Brooks Robinson, not Frank, was Baltimore's Hall of Fame third baseman. But Machado deserves credit for his humility, especially on the field.Orioles manager Buck Showalter said Machado has ''put some good swings on some good pitches and they've carried over the fence.''I'd put myself in his shoes, I'm sure he's having a blast. But he doesn't want to do anything to upset the apple cart toward the other team. He's been very respectful of the competition, and that's something that we've tried to do all year.''Mike Moustakas homered for the Royals, who went 4-3 on a road swing against the White Sox and Orioles. Kansas City has 15 home runs over its last eight games.But the Royals had no answer for Machado, who went 6 for 16 with six extra-base hits and seven RBIs in the four games.''I like him. I was impressed,'' Royals manager Ned Yost said. ''The scouting reports that we got said he had a couple of holes in his swing. We couldn't find them. He hurt us. He won two games for them against us with homers. He hit the ball to center field. He hits the ball to left field.''Chen said, ''He's going to be a good player for a long time. We better get used to making good pitches to him.''Baltimore went up 4-3 in the sixth. After Chen issued two straight walks, Reynolds greeted Louis Coleman with an RBI single to left. The Orioles added an unearned run in the eighth.Luis Ayala (4-3) worked the sixth, and Troy Patton and Pedro Strop each got three outs before Jim Johnson finished for his 34th save in 37 opportunities.''We've had a couple games where we had to use a lot of people,'' Showalter said. ''But we felt at the time we could keep it close and we could match up out of the bullpen the last four innings.''Orioles starter Tommy Hunter gave up three runs and eight hits in five innings. The right-hander has yielded at least one home run in 10 straight starts, and the two walks were Hunter's most in a game since April 24.After stranding runners at the corners in the first inning, the Orioles took a 2-0 lead in the second. Reynolds led off with a walk before Machado hit a drive to center that umpires initially ruled bounced off the top of the wall. After a quick replay review, Machado broke into his home-run trot from second base.Moustakas ended an 0-for-10 drought with a liner off the foul pole in right field leading off the fourth, and Brayan Pena added a sacrifice fly to tie it at 2.The Royals got a run in the fifth when Alex Gordon and Alcides Escobar singled ahead of a double-play grounder by Moustakas. In the bottom half, Markakis knotted the score at 3 and ended Chen's run of 11 straight outs with a drive to right on a 3-2 pitch.NOTES: Baltimore's Adam Jones started at DH for the first time in his career.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Kansas City Royals, and Alex Gordon in particular, showed their late-night prowess on a dreary night at Camden Yards.Gordon hit two of Kansas City's four home runs, Luis Mendoza took a shutout into the seventh inning and the Royals beat the Baltimore Orioles 7-3 Saturday night after the start of the game was delayed by rain for more than three hours.Salvador Perez and Billy Butler also connected for the Royals, who have 14 homers in their last seven games. Gordon has nine home runs this season, three in this four-game series that concludes Sunday afternoon.The game started at 10:14 p.m. and spilled into Sunday morning, finally ending at 1:13 a.m.''Same ballpark, same rain delay, same weather conditions,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''They did a better job with it than we did.''Especially Gordon, who homered in the first inning and again in the seventh, taking advantage of the short distance to left field on both occasions.Asked to explain his power surge, Gordon said, ''Probably the park a little bit. Take advantage of the places you play and the conditions you play under.''Mendoza (6-8) gave up three runs and seven hits over six-plus innings in his first appearance against the Orioles since 2008. Two of his 12 career wins have come against Baltimore.Chris Tillman (5-2) allowed six runs and six hits, including three homers, in 5 2-3 innings.Both pitchers were thrown off their usual pattern because of the delay, but Tillman was the only one who struggled.''It's a challenge. Their guy did a good job with it,'' Showalter said. ''We had two or three times it looked like we were going to be able to start. Then a bunch of cells keep popping up. It's hard to predict, being this close to the (Chesapeake) Bay. It's nobody's fault. I feel bad for the fans that toughed it out that we weren't able to play a bit better.''The Royals had no desire to play a doubleheader on Sunday or stay through Monday for a makeup game, so they were delighted when the game finally got under way.''We needed to play,'' manager Ned Yost said. ''We have a mutual off day on Monday but we have a charity golf tournament a lot of the players need to be at, so we couldn't stay. We wanted to do everything we could to get this in.''Coming in, Tillman yielded only two home runs in 34 innings this season. In his only previous start against the Royals, in July 2009, the right-hander also surrendered three home runs.Playing in his third major league game, Baltimore third baseman Manny Machado went 1 for 4 with an RBI double. It was another solid outing for the 20-year-old, the first player in modern baseball history (since 1900) to have two homers and a triple in his first two games, according to information provided to the Orioles by the Elias Sports Bureau.Adam Jones had two hits for the Orioles, who lost for the second time in eight games.After a delay of 3 hours, 9 minutes, Gordon hit Tillman's third pitch into the left-field seats. It was Gordon's fourth leadoff homer of the season, the second in this series.Lorenzo Cain led off the second inning with a single and Perez followed with his eighth home run, the second in two nights.Butler homered on a 3-0 pitch in the third to make it 4-0. Butler's career-high 24 home runs are the most by a Royal since Carlos Beltran hit 26 in 2003.Kansas City got two runs in the sixth. After Eric Hosmer hit an RBI single, Jeff Francoeur was credited with stealing home when Orioles catcher Matt Wieters threw wildly trying to get Hosmer at second on a double-steal.Gordon homered off Miguel Socolovich leading off the seventh. Gordon's only previous two-homer game was against Minnesota in 2007.Baltimore chased Mendoza in the bottom half. Following a walk and a single, Machado bounced a double inside the third base line before Omar Quintanilla singled in two runs. But with runners at second and third and two outs, Jones grounded out.NOTES: The Orioles unveiled a statue of slugger Eddie Murray in the picnic area beyond the bullpen area in center field. Murray is the fourth of six Orioles Hall of Fame stars to be honored with a sculpture during the 20th anniversary of Camden Yards. Statues of Earl Weaver, Jim Palmer, Frank Robinson and Murray have already been put in place, and those of Cal Ripken and Brooks Robinson will be unveiled in September. ...

', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Orioles 7, Red Sox 1: We were promised home runs!', ' The Baltimore Orioles started off their series with the Boston Red Sox with a bang, slugging three home runs to support their starter Wei-Yin Chen, who struggled at times but came through with six innings of one-run baseball. The win puts the Orioles 10 games over .500 and keeps them at the top of the Wild Card race for another day. Oh, Red Sox. How the tides have turned. Not to be the arrogant Orioles fan, but with a 7-3 record so far this season and having won 13 of their last 17 against them (h/t Britt Ghiroli), it\'s getting so that I actually look forward to seeing them on the schedule. Josh Beckett was the starting pitcher for the Red Sox tonight, and for the first few innings it looked like he might not be the Josh Beckett that the world has gotten used to seeing this season. He got through two innings with little trouble, but then had to face the Orioles secret weapon: Omar Quintanilla. Omar socked a home run to the flag court in right field to give the Orioles a 1-0 lead. It was the best kind of homer, the kind that makes the opposing team\'s right fielder just turn and watch. It was Quintanilla\'s third home run as an Oriole and the sixth of his career. The lead was short-lived, as the Red Sox scored their one and only run in the top of the fourth inning. Cody Ross led off with a double and came around to score on a single from Carl Crawford. The Red Sox couldn\'t turn it into a rally, though as Chen struck out Mike Aviles and got Danny Valencia on a fly ball to end the inning. A two-out triple in the top of the fifth inning by Dustin Pedroia put on the go-ahead run for the Red Sox, but Chen induced a ground out from Adrian Gonzalez.    Mark Reynolds had a big day today. It started in the fifth inning with an opposite field home run to the flag court. It\'s a rare day when Reynolds goes opposite field, and it gave the O\'s a 2-1 lead. They couldn\'t do anything else in the inning and I found myself thinking, ""Come on, guys! It\'s Josh Beckett!"" But they knew, and they took full advantage in the next inning.    Despite just one run on the board through five innings, Chen\'s stuff didn\'t look as sharp as it has on other occasions. It started to look dicey in the sixth inning, as singles by Ross and Crawford put runners on first and third with one out. You see, the problem for the Red Sox is that when Ross and Crawford do something, they\'re followed by Aviles and Valencia. We know that feeling, don\'t we? Chen struck out Aviles for the third time, and Valencia again flew out. Well done, Chen! Now, the bottom of the sixth. That\'s when it got really fun, friends. J.J. Hardy started things off with a seeing-eye single to left field, and after Nate McLouth popped out, Adam Jones took a walk. Both runners moved up on a wild pitch, then Matt Wieters hit a high Baltimore Chop towards the pitchers mound. As Beckett, Pedroia, and Aviles converged on the ball, it slipped under Aviles\' glove and Hardy came in to score the third run.    For some reason, Jones didn\'t move to third on the infield hit by Wieters. It could have ended up looking like a real bone-headed move, but it turned out that it didn\'t matter. Chris Davis singled to right field and Jones scored easily to make the score 4-1. Davis was the last batter that Beckett pitched to, and he left the game with just one out and two runners on base. The Red Sox fans in the crowd (they\'re still there, sadly) booed him as he left the field. He was replaced by Mark Melancon, who threw one pitch to Reynolds. That\'s all it took for Reynolds to crush a pitch to left field for his second home run of the night. The three-run bomb gave the O\'s a lead of 7-1, and made Beckett\'s final pitching line: 5.1 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 2 BB, 2 K, 2 HR. Armed with a big lead, Chen came back out to start the seventh, but didn\'t record an out. Jacoby Ellsbury singled and Buck pulled him to a nice ovation from the crowd. Time to turn to the bullpen. I love the bullpen! First up was Darren O\'Day, who struck out Pedro Ciriaco but then gave up a double to Pedroia to put runners on second and third. He walked the next batter, Gonazalez, on just four pitches. Was he pitching around him? If so, it worked. O\'Day then struck out both Ross and Ryan Lavarnway to get out of trouble. That was it for rallies from both sides, as the bullpens shut things down from there. J.C. Romero made his Orioles debut, pitching one inning in which he gave up a single. Matt Lindstrom pitched a 1-2-3 ninth to finish the game. Great game by the O\'s. Let\'s do it again tomorrow!  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), ('Series Preview: Boston Red Sox @ Baltimore Orioles - Aug ...', "" Coming to town for a three-game set beginning tonight are the Boston Red Sox, who currently sit in fourth place in the American League East. They are 11.5 games out of first place and 5.5 games behind the Orioles, who are in third place (one loss behind the Rays). The Red Sox are a bit of a disaster right now, and that's just the way I like it. But they're still a team with a lot of talent and not one to be taken lightly. Their biggest issue this season has been their pitching. Jon Lester and Josh Beckett have been terrible compared to their past performances, the Daniel-Bard-as-starter experiment has yielded mediocre results, and the surprise addition to their rotation has been Aaron Cook, who seems to alternate between serviceable and awful. There are more than a few people who think the Boston Red Sox are, despite their woes this season, a better baseball team than the Baltimore Orioles. To these people I say: Scoreboard. Not only do the Orioles have a healthy lead on the Red Sox in both the division and the wild card race, they have beaten the Red Sox six out of nine times so far this season. Overall, the Red Sox offense is about league average, with an OPS+ of 101. They have the third-best slugging percentage in the AL but much of that is thanks to David Ortiz and Will Middlebrooks, both of whom are on the disabled list. It's said that Ortiz will be back soon, but Middlebrooks is out for the season with a broken wrist. What the Red Sox lost when Ortiz went on the DL in mid-July they gained in Adrian Gonzalez, who has been absolutely on fire the last month. The Red Sox would have done well to have both Ortiz and Gonzo hitting like crazy at the same time. Oh well...    Tuesday: Wei-Yin Chen vs. Josh Beckett When we last saw Chen, he was getting lit up by the Kansas City Royals on his very own t-shirt day. Before that he strung together five good starts in a row and I'm not worried about him. This will be Chen's third time facing the Red Sox this season. In his first start he was shaky, but he pitched seven good innings with just one run allowed back on June 6th.    Beckett also got rocked in his last start, giving up 8 runs in 5 innings against the Texas Rangers. Unlike Chen, he didn't have a strong run of pitching before that. He did pitch well against the Orioles the last time out, which figures. But his game log for the 2012 season is a big old mess. Wednesday: Miguel Gonzalez vs. Aaron Cook Miguel Gonzalez isn't good enough for an SBN tag yet, but he seems to be built out of Orioles magic. He's balancing a lovely 3.42 ERA with a ghastly 5.18 FIP, and despite a less the impressive home run rate, walk rate, WHIP,  you name it, he's succeeding. If you think about it, Gonzalez is a microcosm of the Orioles season.    Cook has made 9 starts for the Red Sox this year and, this is no joke, his K/9 is 1. ONE. He's never been a strikeout guy in his career, but I didn't even realize one was possible. He has struck out six guys in 51 2/3 inning. He's walked seven. I don't even know what to do with that information. Cook pitched well against Texas his last time out (he struck out a season-high of 2!), but he has more clunkers this season than beauties. Cook has been just awful this season against lefties and quite good against righties. That's been the story his whole career, but it's magnified in 2012. Thursday: Chris Tillman vs. Clay Buchholz Oh, Chris. I don't know what to do with you. You were terrible against KC after the three-hour rain delay. You've been good against bad offenses, you were bad against the Yankees for only one inning, who knows what's going on with your velocity. WHO ARE YOU? I know who Clay Buchholz is. He's the guy who threw a no-hitter against the Orioles. He's also probably the Red Sox best starter right now. He struggled early in the season but since June he's been quite good. He's coming off of a complete-game win against the Indians and also pitched a complete-game shutout against the Orioles in June. They knocked him around two other times this season, but both were in May and he's turned it around since then. I don't have much faith in the O's against him (especially with Tillman on the mound), so taking the first two games of the series is pretty important.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- It's payback time for the Baltimore Orioles, who have dominated the Boston Red Sox this season after being bullied by their AL East rivals for the better part of 15 years.Mark Reynolds homered twice and drove in four runs, Omar Quintanilla also went deep, and Baltimore beat Josh Beckett and the Red Sox 7-1 Tuesday night.Wei-Yin Chen (11-7) gave up one run, nine hits and a walk in six-plus innings for the Orioles, who moved 10 games over .500 (63-53) for the first time since June 24. Chen allowed at least one hit in each inning but was effective in minimizing the damage.Baltimore is 7-3 against Boston this year, including 5-1 at Fenway Park. The Orioles have won the season series against the Red Sox only once since 1996, going 10-9 in 2004.The trend seems to have reversed, and the Orioles can only hope it lasts.''We've been playing really well against them all year,'' said Chris Davis, who had two hits and an RBI. ''It was big for us to get the win and kind of set the tone for the series.''This isn't the same Boston club that lost in Baltimore on the final day of the season last year to fall out of the playoff picture.This Red Sox team is 57-60, and Dustin Pedroia acknowledged after the game that there were a series of meetings in New York last month to discuss the team's decline under first-year manager Bobby Valentine.''I know the coaches had a meeting, Bobby had a meeting, we all had a meeting,'' Pedroia said. ''Basically when I spoke I said we all had to be better. That means the owners, Bobby, coaches, especially the players. I have had one problem with Bobby earlier in the year and I went into his office and talked to him like a man and he talked to me like a man. And we've been great. We've had a great relationship.''Pedroia said Valentine should keep his job.''I don't think Bobby should be fired,'' he said. ''Listen, we haven't played well and I am not going to blame anything on Bobby and I don't think anybody else is. It's on the players, man. Last year wasn't on (manager Terry Francona). I know he took it hard. We all did. It's on the players, man.''Beckett (5-10) surrendered six runs and six hits, including two home runs, in 5 1-3 innings.''You have to keep the ball down,'' he said. ''This isn't a real friendly ballpark (for pitchers).''It's been a nightmare season for the right-hander, 1-6 in 12 starts since May 20. In his past two outings against Texas and Baltimore, Beckett has yielded a combined 14 runs and five homers in 10 1-3 innings.Reynolds hit a solo shot off Beckett in the fifth and greeted Mark Melancon with a three-run drive in the sixth. After totaling 113 homers over the three previous seasons, Reynolds has only 11 this year. It was his first multihomer game since last Sept. 21, when he connected twice against Beckett.Playing in his fifth major league game, Baltimore's Manny Machado was held hitless for the first time. But he made two fine plays at third base, where he has yet to make an error.Boston stranded 12 and went 1 for 10 with runners in scoring position, a shortcoming fueled by cleanup hitter Adrian Gonzalez. He made the final out in the first, third and fifth innings, stranding a runner on second or third each time, and finished 0 for 4 with a walk.Quintanilla hit Beckett's first pitch of the third inning over the right-field wall to put the Orioles up 1-0. He has four homers this season (including one with the Mets), after hitting only two in 227 games before this year.Boston used a double by Cody Ross and an RBI single by Carl Crawford to pull even in the fourth.Pedroia tripled with two outs in the fifth before Gonzalez grounded out. In the bottom half, Reynolds hit an opposite-field drive over the right-field wall to put Baltimore back on top.Reynolds' homer, on Melancon's first pitch, capped a five-run sixth.NOTES: A moment of silence was observed before the game for former Boston star Johnny Pesky, who died Monday. ... The Orioles placed LHP Troy Patton (ankle) on the 15-day DL and recalled RHP Steve Johnson from Triple-A Norfolk. ... The Red Sox activated RHP Andrew Bailey (thumb) from the 60-day DL. He got the last out in the eighth. Boston traded C Kelly Shoppach to the Mets following a waiver claim. Ryan Lavarnway started behind the plate for Boston and went 1 for 4. ... Boston's Jacoby Ellsbury singled in the first inning to extend his hitting streak against Baltimore to 37 straight games, the longest by a Red Sox player against one team. ... Beckett has a strikeout in each of his 299 major league games, the second-longest streak to begin a career since 1900 behind Dwight Gooden (349). ... Rookie Miguel Gonzalez starts for the Orioles on Wednesday night against Boston's Aaron Cook, who makes his first career appearance at Camden Yards. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('1997: The Voice of the Orioles, Silenced - Camden Chat', ' The 1997 series that we had planned for this series never quite got off the ground. There are lot of reasons for our negligence, not the least of which is the fact that the 2012 Orioles have been exciting to watch for most of this season, something that few of us anticipated when we decided to write about ""the last good year."" When we first decided to do the series, one of the first things I knew I wanted to write about was Rex Barney. Despite their winning ways in 1997, the Orioles were not without tragedy, including Eric Davis\' cancer diagnosis and of course, the death of Mr. Barney on August 12, 1997.  His was truly the voice of Baltimore sports, as he broadcast for not only the Orioles from 1974-1997, but also the Baltimore Colts from 1959-1983. His voice was the sound of summer, familiar and simple. He didn\'t buy into gimmicks or, as some PA announcers tend to, make himself a part of the action. Other than his trademark sayings: ""Thank youuuu"" and ""Give that fan a contract,"" (or every now and then, ""Give that fan...an error!""), Rex Barney left the action to the game itself, he just provided the framework.  The first baseball game I ever went to at a place other than Memorial Stadium or Oriole Park at Camden Yards was in 1992 at New Comiskey Park (now called US Cellular Field). The White Sox were hosting the Twins, but I don\'t remember who won the game. I do remember it was Carlton Fisk Commemorative Cup Night, and that the first time I heard their PA announcer it confused the heck out of me. As a child I\'d never given much thought to Rex Barney. I suppose I knew his name as a thirteen-year-old, but maybe I didn\'t. But I knew what a PA announcer at a baseball game was supposed to sound like, and this person screaming at the top of his lungs was not it.    Maybe because it was his commemorative cup night, but the one name I remember the announcer calling most was Fisk\'s. It went like this, ""Now batting....number 72....CARRRRRRRRLLLLLLLTONNNN FISSSSKKK!!!!!"" I have no idea who the PA announcer for the White Sox was, but even then, he was absurd. It was the first time in my life that I specifically remember thinking about how good the Orioles had it.    Rex Barney suffered a number of physical ailments in his old age. He had diabetes that led to him losing one of his legs, and he suffered a heart attack in 1995. He\'d had to miss time at the ballpark a few times when he was sick, but he was never out for long. On July 30, 1997, the Orioles played the Texas Ranger at home, beating them 3-1 before heading to the west coast for a nine-game road trip, a game in which Rex Barney worked. On the morning of August 12th, before the Orioles played a night game against the Athletics, Mr. Barney was found passed away at home by a friend. He was 72 years old.    In honor of his memory, the Orioles played their game on the night of August 12th without a public address announcer. Since we last heard Rex Barney over the loudspeaker at Camden Yards, the Orioles have had two PA announcers: Dave McGowan, who just retired after last season, and Ryan Wagner, who is in his first season in the job. Both were good selections by the Orioles as they follow in Rex Barney\'s understated tradition, and I\'m very happy that the Orioles didn\'t decide to go in another direction when they had the chance. When I think back to the baseball of my childhood, I can still hear Rex Barney\'s voice as Cal Ripken steps to the plate. It\'s as ingrained in me as much as anything sports-related can be. And with the unveiling of the legends statues this season, I\'ve thought about him more than once. He saw so many baseball games with all of those legends, and in the process became a Baltimore legend himself. It almost seems a shame that there is no tribute to him anywhere in the ballpark. reference  ', 'www.camdenchat.com'), (""Orioles' Wilson Betemit dealing with a sore right wrist ..."", '/* Javascript deferred */var addthis_options = ""digg, twitter, facebook, stumbleupon, delicious, friendfeed, buzz, slashdot, reddit, mixx, fark, linkedin, aim, google, myspace, newsvine, technorati, tumblr, typepad, wordpress, more"";var addthis_exclude = ""print"";var addthis_pub     = ""archivedigger"";/* Javascript deferred */Wilson Betemit dealing with a sore right wristJim Thome delivers a detailed scouting report on Dylan BundyAugust 15, 2012|By Everett Cook | The Baltimore SunOrioles\' infielder Wilson Betemit hasn\'t played since last Saturday, but it turns out there might be a reason other than the arrival of prospect Manny Machado from the minor leagues.Before Wednesday\'s game, Orioles\' manager Buck Showalter revealed Betemit has been dealing with a sore right wrist since before Tuesday\'s game, and he will get an MRI on the wrist Thursday. The club is hopeful that it is nothing more than tendinitis.""He tried to hit a little bit today, and he\'s day to day,"" Showalter said Wednesday.

Because the right wrist is the bottom wrist on left-handed swings, it could spell trouble for Betemit\'s production from that side of the plate.Reynolds is hitting .196 against right-handers, but .266 against left-handers.Of course, statistics aren\'t foolproof, and baseball is a fickle game. Reynolds carried the Orioles\' offense last night, hitting two home runs and driving in four runs. One of those homers was against right-handed Boston starter Josh Beckett.If Betemit\'s wrist wasn\'t acting up, there\'s a chance Reynolds wouldn\'t have started Tuesday, and wouldn\'t have hit those two home runs.Thome the scoutTop pitching prospect Dylan Bundy made his Double-A debut Tuesday night in Bowie, and the Orioles sent one man more than usual to scout the 19-year-old\'s start.That unconventional scout was Orioles slugger Jim Thome \xe2\x80\x94 he of 19 major league seasons \xe2\x80\x94 who is rehabbing a herniated disk in his neck.Showalter sent Thome to Bowie to get a hitter\'s perspective on Bundy, and the 41-year old Thome was impressed with what he saw.""He has a big bright career ahead of him,"" Thome said of Bundy on Wednesday. ""He\'s definitely got so much upside to him. He might be one of the best young pitchers I have seen in quite a while.""Showalter was also impressed with the job that Thome did scouting, saying the report he got back from his veteran designated hitter was very similar to the report that he got back from the regular scouts.""Jimmy\'s got a future,"" Showalter said. ""He enjoyed it too, and said he had a lot of fun.""Even though Showalter thinks Thome has a future in scouting or development after his playing days, Thome wouldn\'t comment on his plans after retirement.""It\'s hard to say. When I\'m done playing I want to spend some time with my kids,"" he said. ""Maybe one day a little bit, but not right away. I want to watch or coach my kids and be around them for a little while. We\'ll see as it goes.""Thome was scheduled to head home to Illinois on Wednesday night to continue rehab on his neck.Matusz to bullpenShowalter announced on Tuesday that the club is going to experiment with former starter Brian Matsuz in the bullpen in Triple-A Norfolk, in hopes of getting another left-handed reliever in Baltimore in September.Executive vice president Dan Duquette said the organization\'s move to make Matusz a reliever fills a temporary need and that the 25-year-old till has a promising future as a starter.""It\'s for now,"" Duquette said. ""It\'s to address a need we have in the big league club we\'ve been trying to address.""Duquette said Matusz was told he\'s moving to the bullpen Tuesday by Norfolk manager Ron Johnson, and he was receptive to the move. Matusz was slated to start Thursday for Norfolk, but Dana Eveland is now scheduled to start that game. Duquette indicated Matusz would be used out of the bullpen starting Wednesday.""We discussed it with him,"" Duquette said. ""For it to succeed, he\'d have to be open to it. He\'s open to it. He may get the call tonight. We\'ll see how he does.""Matusz was sent down to Triple-A early last month after going 5-10 with a 5.42 ERA in 16 starts with the Orioles. But the O\'s believe he\'s established a resume of success getting left-handed hitters out, which could be best served in the bullpenOver the course of his major league career, Matusz has held left-handers to a .233/.281/384 batting line, and he has a 4.48 strikeout-to-walk ratio against lefty batters. This season, he held major league lefties to a .174/.237/.302 line.""We\'ve been considering it for a little while,"" Duquette said. ""We\'ve been trying to see if we could add another left-hander to our bullpen, so we looked at some of our internal options, too. Brian\'s always had a good record of getting out lefties his whole career. He gets out lefties very, very well.""Duquette didn\'t put a timetable on how long it might take Matusz to get adjusted to the bullpen.""We\'d like him to get some experience in the job and get comfortable with the warmup routine,"" Duquette said.

There is even a couch shaped like a baseball glove at the entrance.Most summers, when the Red Sox are in town to face the Orioles, the lobby of this hotel buzzes with Boston fans. But a few hours before the teams met on Wednesday night, all was calm. Bill MacInnis, a Red Sox fan from Stamford, Conn., sat on a chair eating popcorn as a cable news program hummed in the background. He was wearing a Red Sox cap, but it was the only one in the room.\xe2\x80\x9cThere aren\xe2\x80\x99t as many Red Sox fans in town as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d MacInnis said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s partly because we\xe2\x80\x99re losing and they\xe2\x80\x99re winning.\xe2\x80\x9dHe was referring to the Orioles, whose last playoff appearance came in 1997 and who have finished in the top three of the American League East just once since. The Orioles beat the Red Sox on Tuesday and Wednesday before losing, 6-3, to them on Thursday. With a 64-54 record, they remained six games behind the Yankees in the division while still holding on to one of the two wild-card slots.

A popular third baseman, Youkilis was traded to the Chicago White Sox in June.Orioles fans, a tortured group, have embraced the chance to reclaim turf they had sometimes ceded.\xe2\x80\x9cIt used to be awful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Judith Ryan, 68, sitting in Section 42 behind home plate as stadium lights glinted off the warehouse above right field. \xe2\x80\x9cNormally we\xe2\x80\x99d be sitting here surrounded by Red Sox hats and jerseys.

They have flaws. They lead the major leagues in errors, are last in stolen bases and have been outscored by 44 runs. Their starting lineup is dotted with journeymen, and their starting pitching is average.Baltimore has thrived with a generally untouchable bullpen, timely hitting and good fortune. Led by the All-Star closer Jim Johnson, the Orioles are 49-0 when leading after seven innings. They have won 12 consecutive extra-inning games and 11 straight one-run games, taking on the cool demeanor of their manager, Buck Showalter.

They haven\'t recorded a sweep of the Red Sox at home and on the road since 1960.Baltimore (64-53) rallied against Boston for the latest victory, scoring all five runs in the sixth after being held hitless the first five innings and falling behind 2-0. Red Sox starter Aaron Cook\'s throwing error contributed to Baltimore\'s big inning, which was capped by Mark Reynolds\' two-run double.The Orioles, who remain in possession of one of the AL\'s two wild-card spots, improved to 8-3 against the Red Sox in 2012.Continuing that success could be key to ending Baltimore\'s postseason drought. The teams are scheduled to play six times over the final two weeks of September, but manager Buck Showalter isn\'t looking ahead.""There\'s so much baseball to be played and so many (teams) involved in this that I think it\'s counterproductive to dwell on it because things can change so quickly in a week\'s time,\'\' Showalter said.The Orioles, who have won three straight and nine of 11, will try to keep things going against Clay Buchholz (10-3, 4.24 ERA).Buchholz is looking to continue a dominating stretch of his own. He is 6-1 with a 2.08 ERA over his last 11 starts and a 1.15 ERA over his last five outings while going 2-0.The right-hander pitched a two-hitter in a 3-2 win over Cleveland last Friday. Only one of the runs - a solo homer in the first - was earned.""That\'s the best I\'ve seen a guy against us, and we\'ve seen some pretty good pitching this year,"" Indians manager Manny Acta said. ""We couldn\'t do anything. He was way too good mixing his pitches.""Buchholz is 1-0 with a 5.00 ERA in three starts against the Orioles in 2012, but threw a four-hitter in a 7-0 win in June. He had allowed 10 runs in a combined nine innings over the previous two outings.Chris Tillman (5-2, 3.40) will counter for Baltimore. He had his four-start winning streak snapped after allowing six runs and six hits, including three homers, in 5 2-3 innings of a 7-3 loss to Kansas City last Saturday.The right-hander is making his first start against the Red Sox this season. He is 0-1 with a 5.68 ERA in two previous appearances.Carl Crawford, who drove in two runs Wednesday, is 7 for 14 with two triples and one double against Tillman. Jacoby Ellsbury, who has a 38-game hitting streak against Baltimore, is 1 for 3 against him.The Red Sox (57-61) fell to 4-10 in August with Wednesday\'s loss, which was the sixth time in eight games they scored three or fewer runs.The offense may not be getting better anytime soon. Boston announced before Wednesday\'s game that David Ortiz, who has been out since mid-July with an Achilles strain, will stop all activity for a few days.

The Orioles won 5-3. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- For five innings, the Baltimore Orioles couldn't muster a single hit against Boston right-hander Aaron Cook.When the Orioles got their third look at the sinkerballer, things changed in a hurry.Baltimore sent 10 batters to the plate during a five-run sixth and beat the Red Sox 5-3 Wednesday night to move a game ahead of Tampa Bay for the top AL wild-card spot.The Orioles trailed 2-0 before rallying against Cook, who fueled the uprising with a throwing error on a potential inning-ending, double-play comebacker. The miscue led to three unearned runs and saddled Cook (3-6) with his fourth loss in five starts.''When you get the ground ball you have to cash in there,'' said Boston manager Bobby Valentine, who was ejected in the eighth. ''We're in the dugout if he makes the play.''Cook allowed only a pair of walks through the first five innings and got 13 of 15 outs on grounders. The first out in the sixth also came on a groundball, and then the trouble began.''He started to get it up,'' Baltimore's Adam Jones said. ''You start to see somebody three times, you get him.''Nick Markakis walked and J.J. Hardy lined a single to left. Nate McLouth hit an RBI single, and with runners on the corners Jones hit a bouncer to Cook, who threw wildly to second as Hardy scored the tying run.''It's a play I've made a 100 times,'' Cook said. ''I just didn't get my feet set. We lost because I made an error.''Matt Wieters put the Orioles in front and chased Cook with an opposite-field, ground-rule double to left. Andrew Miller got Chris Davis to hit a grounder to drawn-in second baseman Dustin Pedroia, who threw home. Jones lowered his left shoulder and ran hard into catcher Jarrod Saltalamacchia, who applied the tag for the second out.''It was fun. It was awesome,'' Jones said of the collision. ''It was much needed.Mark Reynolds followed with a two-run double off Junichi Tazawa for a 5-2 lead, and that was enough to propel the Orioles (64-53) to their ninth win in 11 games.''I feel like we just don't give up,'' Hardy said. ''We know that at any point we can go out there and score runs.''Baltimore is alone in second place in the AL East and making a run at the postseason, but manager Buck Showalter says it's too early to get excited.''There's so much baseball to be played and so many (teams) involved in this that I think it's counterproductive to dwell on it because things can change so quickly in a week's time,'' he said.Rookie Miguel Gonzalez (5-2) allowed two runs and six hits in six innings for the Orioles and Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 35th save in 38 tries. The game ended with rookie third baseman Manny Machado making a diving stab of Nick Punto's liner down the line.Carl Crawford had two RBIs for the Red Sox, who have lost six of eight to fall four games under .500 (57-61) for the first time since May 13.Cleanup hitter Adrian Gonzalez and Valentine were both ejected in the eighth inning for arguing with home plate umpire Mike Everitt.Both contended that Orioles reliever Pedro Strop threw a quick pitch to Gonzalez, who bounced out to second.''I wasn't even set,'' Gonzalez said. ''I was just sitting there waiting for him to come set so I can get into my stance. We're trying to win a game. I'm the leadoff hitter, down two runs, trying to get on base.''Crawford got Boston to 5-3 in the seventh with a run-scoring groundout, but Boston went down in order in the eighth and ninth.The Red Sox are 3-8 against Baltimore this season and have lost five of the past six series between the teams dating to last season.Limited to two singles and a walk through four innings, Boston grabbed a 2-0 lead in the fifth. After Scott Podsednik and Punto singled, Jacoby Ellsbury doubled in a run and Crawford followed with a sacrifice fly.NOTES: Omar Quintanilla made the first and last outs in the Baltimore sixth. ...

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The Boston Red Sox, and Clay Buccholz in particular, put on a good show for three members of the team ownership committee who ventured to Camden Yards to get a firsthand look at their struggling ballclub.Buchholz shook off a rocky start to earn his 11th win, Dustin Pedroia singled in the tiebreaking run in the sixth inning and the Red Sox beat the Baltimore Orioles 6-3 Thursday night to avoid a three-game sweep.Principal owner John Henry, chairman Thomas Werner and president and CEO Larry Lucchino were all in attendance following a rough stretch in which Boston lost six of eight to bring up questions surrounding the job security of first-year manager Bobby Valentine.The trio visited the clubhouse before the game and showed up again afterward.''They said they were bringing us luck,'' Valentine said. ''After we started (behind) 2-0, I was looking for an early flight home.''After giving up three runs and six hits over the first two innings, Buchholz (11-3) kept the Orioles at bay while the Red Sox rebounded from a 3-1 deficit. The right-hander ended up allowing three runs, eight hits and three walks over eight innings. He struck out seven.''He brought the competitive spirit to a new level tonight,'' Valentine said. ''They were jumping on his early pitches, he got down early. But when he saw we had some resiliency in our offense, he shut the door. He shut it quick.''Buchholz was delighted to perform so well for the men who sign his paycheck.''They are the ones that put the team together,'' he said. ''It was good to see those guys here. It added motivation. They've got busy lives, so they could have been somewhere else. Instead, they were here showing us they were behind us and supporting us.''Alfredo Aceves worked a perfect ninth for his 24th save.Adrian Gonzalez had two RBIs and Cody Ross chipped in with three hits for Boston. Serving as designated hitter for the first time this season, Jacoby Ellsbury went 0 for 4 to end his 38-game hitting streak against Baltimore.Mark Reynolds homered and Adam Jones had two RBIs for the Orioles, now 8-4 against Boston this season. Reynolds has four homers in his last six games after going 20 straight without one.Despite the loss, Baltimore finished 7-3 on a homestand against Seattle, Kansas City and the Red Sox.''Our guys wanted to win all 10. That's the way we approached it,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''Tonight they took advantage of some of our pitching struggles.''The Red Sox took a 6-3 lead with a three-run sixth against Luis Ayala (4-4). With runners at the corners and two outs, Pedroia hit a short chopper toward third that a charging Manny Machado couldn't handle. Gonzalez and Ross followed with run-scoring singles.Before the game, talk in the Boston clubhouse centered around Ellsbury, a fixture in the Boston outfield playing DH for the first time since July 18, 2011. Valentine said, ''The last couple days we have been concerned about a leg situation. This is just being overcautious and aware of the situation.''Ellsbury, however, said, ''My leg feels good. I played the last two nights on it.''Coming in, Orioles starter Chris Tillman had allowed 24 runs this season - 14 in the first inning. After striking out Ellsbury to begin the game, Tillman gave up a one-out double to Carl Crawford before retiring Pedroia and Gonzalez.Baltimore went up 2-0 in the bottom half. Nick Markakis and J.J. Hardy singled before Jones hit an opposite-field, two-run double inside the first base line.Boston got a run in the second on a two-out RBI single by Scott Podsednik.Reynolds homered on the first pitch in the Orioles' half with a drive to center. It was an uncharacteristic start for Buchholz, who didn't allow more than two runs in any of his previous five outings and had a 1.15 ERA over that span.''Clay had a rough time early, then after that he threw a gem,'' Ross said.The Red Sox pulled even in the fifth. Crawford singled, took third on a double by Pedroia and scored on a wild pitch. Gonzalez followed with a sacrifice fly to chase Tillman, who threw 110 pitches in 4 2-3 innings.''You've got to tip your hat a little bit to Boston; they really made (Tillman) work for everything,'' Showalter said. ''They had a lot of foul balls. He had a lot of counts in his favor but he couldn't finish hitters off.''NOTES: Boston received RHP Pedro Beato from the Mets as the player to be named in the trade Tuesday that sent C Kelly Shoppach to New York.

It didn\xe2\x80\x99t end the way they wanted \xe2\x80\x93 with a sweep of the Boston Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 but rather with a sobering 6-3 loss. But think about where the Orioles are as they embark on a six-game trip to Detroit and Texas. Despite the loss, they are tied with the Tampa Bay Rays for the American League wild-card spots. They are six games back of the division-leading New York Yankees (they trailed by 10 games this time a month ago). The Orioles arrived in Detroit early Friday morning. Tonight, they will be welcomed by Tigers ace Justin Verlander, who has allowed just one earned run over 15 innings in his past two starts. var adSkipCounter = 0;  \xe2\x80\x9cIt doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get any easier,\xe2\x80\x9d said Orioles first baseman Mark Reynolds, who was 11-for-28 with four homers, three doubles and 10 RBIs on the homestand. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re looking forward to it.\xe2\x80\x9d It\xe2\x80\x99s a daunting task.

But we also said the same thing last month, when the Orioles went to New York and Tampa Bay and returned winners of four of six and with series victories against both teams. If they can keep games close late, they can be successful. \xe2\x80\x9cWe had a solid homestand with a few come-from-behind wins, a few just playing really good baseball,\xe2\x80\x9d center fielder Adam Jones said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ve just got to go on the road. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got two teams that are first or second place in their division, so this is going to be a strong road trip, just like the last one was when we were in New York and Tampa. So this is kind of similar. We\xe2\x80\x99ve got to go and play good baseball and as a team become victorious. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t matter how we do it. Who cares how we do it.

""He always had his head down.""That provokes a vivid memory of No. 46, the smart pitcher who studied all and fooled many of the 11,684 batters he faced over 18 major league seasons. He was the long-haired lefty with a mustache who won the American League Cy Young Award in the Orioles\' 1979 World Series season. He was all business on the mound, and Alex is correct about Mike\'s demeanor during his walk to the dugout after most of his 2,770 innings: head down, serious, pondering what he had just done well or not so well.Maybe it was modesty, or a taciturn manner he\'d picked up in his native New England. But maybe Mike was sullen and full of doubt, too. var adSkipCounter = 0; ""Most people won\'t believe it,"" says Alex, in her first interview since her husband\'s death, ""but I don\'t think Mike ever believed in himself. He felt like a failure. And there were times when he hated himself and felt that he was a fake, that he had just been lucky. ... He was self-effacing in his humor, that was part of his charm, but that was a cover for insecurity.""Perhaps we make too much of the head-down walk. Certainly, other pitchers have carried themselves that way. But considering how Mike\'s life ended last year at the age of 59 \xe2\x80\x94 with a shotgun blast Aug. 24 on the grounds of his stone farmhouse in Baltimore County \xe2\x80\x94 everything becomes the subject of reflection and questions.Those of us who were his friends \xe2\x80\x94 I was a fishing companion of Mike\'s for 20 years \xe2\x80\x94 have been trying to understand, searching for clues in the things he said and did. The person closest to him, of course, was Alex. She saw a Mike Flanagan of doubt and pain the rest of us missed.He had financial pressures, she says, in part from a lapse of steady income between jobs as the Orioles\' vice president for baseball operations and as color commentator on game telecasts, that caused him to dip deeply into savings and into his player pension. He expressed resentment about the way he was treated after he lost his front-office job in 2008. He asked if I wanted to write a book about ""the demise of a great baseball franchise,"" then put the idea on hold after he started working as an Orioles broadcaster again in 2010.Those issues, money pressures and career disappointments, were the explanations that trickled out in the immediate aftermath of Mike\'s death. But they seemed too simple.""The public wanted a reason why Mike killed himself,"" Alex says. ""They wanted accountability and to blame something or someone.\xc2\xa0They needed a reason for an unreasonable act, and I understand because I\'ve gone through all these questions myself.""Absent what she calls ""a definitive answer to an impossible question,"" Alex shares observations about Mike, hoping they provide missing details. First and foremost, she says, he was depressed, and for a long time.""He used to talk about shadows,"" she says in the den of the farmhouse, a couple of dogs and some packing crates nearby. ""He would say, \'Sometimes there\'s this shadow that comes into my life,\' and he wouldn\'t see anything good, just these shadows. ... He would see the world in black and white, without color.""She says Mike saw a psychiatrist for 20 years, but wonders whether he and his doctor were ever able to identify the source of the shadows.""Mike always wanted to be the one who told people the good news,"" she says, suggesting that he had not been candid with his doctor. ""He never wanted to be the bearer of bad news.""Especially about himself.""Mike didn\'t talk or share much with anyone, which is what I wanted from him more than anything else,"" Alex says. ""He was never fully able to open up. He was ashamed of not being perfect, he was afraid of hurting anyone.""In all the times I went fishing with him \xe2\x80\x94 he always caught more trout than I did, but never bragged \xe2\x80\x94 Mike rarely opened up about problems, and I didn\'t pry. He\'d sometimes briefly vent about the frustrations of trying to make the Orioles a winning franchise again. He shared unhappiness about his status in the organization after his stint as vice president. He expressed disappointment and sadness that the widow of Elrod Hendricks, the beloved Orioles catcher and bullpen coach, suggested that the club had treated her husband \xe2\x80\x94 Mike\'s longtime friend \xe2\x80\x94 poorly in the weeks before his fatal heart attack in December 2005.But most of the time with me, Mike was affable and funny, telling dozens of stories about his teammates from the 1970s and \'80s. He certainly never mentioned money problems or seeing a psychiatrist.Alex goes back to Mike\'s dugout walk \xe2\x80\x94 head down, even after striking out the side. Something haunted him, and she\'s convinced it went clear back to his childhood in New Hampshire.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

', 'articles.baltimoresun.com'), (""Orioles 3, Tigers 2: Zach Britton's Big Comeback"", "" Zach Britton was so bad in his first two August starts that he was invited to return to the minor leagues to think things over. After the Orioles extended him that invitation, he did not have anything resembling a good start. Then desperation struck the big club once again, and Britton's name came out of the hat when a starter was needed for tonight's game. Why would anyone without inside knowledge have thought Britton would do well? I'm not so sure that people with that inside information believed Britton would do well, just that they recognized he was the least objectionable of a series of unpalatable menu options. The brigade of pessimists, myself in their number, braced for the inevitable disaster as Britton loaded the bases in the first inning, giving up two singles and a walk. The Tigers had the sacks full, and one out, and Britton got the double play he needed, escaping from the jam. We've seen starts like these before, where the shaky first inning becomes a shaky second inning. Zach was not playing by those rules today. He settled down, improbably, and ended up throwing seven shutout innings, scattering a total of six hits and three walks while getting five strikeouts. After that first inning, there were only three Tigers in scoring position while Zach was pitching - and one of those was the result of an error where Nate McLouth dropped a routine pop fly. The error did not end up mattering. He bore down, holding up his end of an unlikely pitcher's duel with another under-performing former prospect, Rick Porcello, who came into the game with a 4.68 ERA. Yet they kept racking up the zeroes as players grounded into double plays or inexplicably ran their way into outs, or just plain could not get on base to begin with. Through six innings, it was a scoreless game. With the two teams involved, it was only a question of who would homer first, and would that first homer be enough to win the game?    Porcello was cruising to enter the top of the 7th. He'd retired the last ten Orioles in a row, with perfect innings in the 4th, 5th and 6th. In the 7th inning, the O's decided they'd had enough of that. Adam Jones led off with a single to center, the first ball all night that fell in front of Tigers center fielder Austin Jackson, who may not be the biggest human vacuum cleaner in MLB, but has to be up there. Matt Wieters followed up with an infield single - yes, really. It was a grounder deep in the hole between 1B and 2B, and while Omar Infante dove and gloved it, Wieters found an extra gear I wasn't sure he had, hustling down the line so much that Infante didn't even bother to throw.    To the plate stepped Chris Davis, who had yet to homer in August. He's been in all kinds of a slump lately, his slash line plummeting, looking lost. When this happens, you sometimes forget just how strong he is, and then he does things to remind you. He took a pitch that had no business being crushed, muscled it opposite field, and it kept carrying, carrying, left fielder Andy Dirks giving chase all the way to the fence, carrying, and finally soared out of there by a safe amount. The Earl Weaver Special put the O's on the board with a 3-0 lead and would prove to be all they'd need on the night. The O's only had two at-bats with runners in scoring position in the game. One of them was the Davis home run. Talk about coming through when it counts. On the other side, the Tigers had 9 ABs with RISP and they were only 1-9.    Detroit's runs scored in the 8th inning off of Pedro Strop, ending a scoreless streak that ran back to July 5. Sometimes Strop is just wild. That's part of the Strop experience. He has a 4.19 BB/9, tough for a set-up man or closer to sustain. It wasn't walks that did him in tonight so much as a hit-by-pitch and a wild pitch. Jackson led off the 8th with a single and advanced on an Infante groundout. Strop hit Miguel Cabrera in the forearm with a fastball that rode in. That brought up last night's Oriole killer, Prince Fielder, but Strop blew a couple fastballs by Prince and then got him to chase a slider that bounced just in front of home plate. No hanging sliders, Pedro! He almost escaped with no damage, but the runners moved up to second and third on one of the wildest wild pitches you'll ever see. It caromed off the backstop towards the O's dugout - Strop was the one who fielded it as Wieters covered home. With two men in scoring position, Peralta hit a liner just hard enough to go over Robert Andino's head at second base, scoring the two runs. When the throw in from Nick Markakis was cut off (probably because it would have been lucky to eventually roll all the way to home plate), Peralta was caught in a rundown and tagged out to end the inning. No big deal, right? Then it was a one-run game - right where the Orioles want 'em. Jim Johnson pitched a perfect 9th. There was nothing remotely threatening about the inning. He notched his 36th save of the season, and the Orioles won their 65th game of the year. Last year, their 65th win came on September 21 and they had a 65-90 record. This year's O's are 65-55. Big difference, huh? The win was also the O's 12th-consecutive win in a one-run game, tying a franchise record that was last reached during the 1979 season. I kind of like getting to make comparisons to years that aren't 2005. Speaking of which, I think we're very close to banishing them for good: the 2005 O's had 75 losses to go along with 65 wins, following up an 8-18 July with an 11-17 August. Our O's this year were 13-14 in July and are 10-6 so far in August. It's in the midst of a tough stretch of games against playoff contenders right now, with one more against Detroit tomorrow and then three in Texas, but I like their chances to improve upon the disastrous outcome of that season. New York lost today, so the O's go back to a 6-game deficit in the American League East standings. Today's win over Detroit puts the O's back into the second wild card spot, with Detroit and Oakland a game behind. The O's will look to put a little more room between them and the competition as they seek a series win tomorrow afternoon. The 1:05pm game will have Doug Fister (3.24 ERA) starting for the Tigers and Wei-Yin Chen (3.70 ERA) starting for the Orioles.

Showalter and Reynolds became upset after an overturned call put Jhonny Peralta on first base after he was called out.Machado made a throw that forced Reynolds to fully extend to catch the ball that was low and up the line, and the first baseman appeared to be pulled off the bag. Replays weren't conclusive.First base umpire Jeff Kellogg called Peralta out after Leyland came out of the dugout to argue. The call was overturned by home plate umpire Tim Timmons.''I had (Reynolds) off the bag,'' Timmons said.Reynolds reacted to that decision by slamming his glove, and he was immediately tossed from the game.''I stayed on the bag and that's why I got so upset,'' Reynolds said. ''I don't understand how an umpire can miss a play at home plate that's right in front of him and see that play from home plate at first base. It's embarrassing that they would overturn a call that obviously has an impact on the game in the middle of the pennant race.''Showalter stormed out of the dugout, was also ejected, and later said the umpires didn't get the call right.Kellogg insisted they did.''We just want to get the play right, and that's what we did there,'' Kellogg said.Machado was charged with an error, but Detroit failed to capitalize.The Orioles didn't take advantage of a vulnerable Verlander.The reigning AL MVP and Cy Young award winner, who has won only one of his last five starts, gave up six hits and struck out six in six innings. He allowed four walks to match a season high.''I was definitely out of sync,'' Verlander said. ''I wasn't quite right.''I was able to keep us in the game, and the big boys did what they do. They can put an entire team on their back.''Baltimore starter Tommy Hunter allowed three runs, four hits and two walks over six innings. Hunter gave up two homers, increasing his season total to 29 - more than any pitcher in the majors this year.NOTES: The Tigers have given up hope of DH Victor Martinez coming back this season after he had surgery on his left knee.

A hard fought game in which the Orioles simply came out on the short end of the stick, right? Absolutely; without a doubt. However there\xe2\x80\x99s more to this story, and unfortunately we haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard the last of this yet. (And when we do I\xe2\x80\x99m afraid that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t end well for the O\xe2\x80\x99s.)If you read my bio on this site or follow my in-game tweets it\xe2\x80\x99s plainly obvious that I have no love for umpires/referees in sports. That\xe2\x80\x99s somewhat of a tongue-in-cheek running joke, however as often as we talk of players being held accountable it seems that we sometimes give officials a pass. I don\xe2\x80\x99t feel that any teams or players in any sports are targeted by umps/refs, and furthermore I do firmly believer that umpires are trying to make the right calls. They\xe2\x80\x99re human just like everyone else, and to a certain point we need to remember that. We also need to remember that one bad call will generally not tell the whole game story. Each team has opportunities to win and to overcome bad calls in each game.However the fact is that the Orioles found themselves playing Family Feud with the umpiring crew last night, specifically home plate umpire Tim Timmons. In the first inning Nick Markakis stood at third base with one out, and Nate McClouth grounded to first base. Prince Fielder made a snap throw home, and Timmons called Markakis out after he appeared to slide directly under the tag. A seething Buck Showalter came out to argue, but to no avail. There was also some question as to whether the ball was fair, but even Showalter dismissed that after the game when he said that he never felt it was foul. He thought that Markakis was safe at first base, a claim that was backed up by MASN replays.The main scene everyone will remember from this game of course occurred in the last of the fifth. Johnny Peralta hit a bouncer to third, and Manny Machado made a bit of an errant throw. Mark Reynolds appeared to come off the bag to save the ball from going up the line, but Peralta was called out by first base umpire Jeff Kellogg. Manager Jim Leyland came out to argue, and quite frankly I thought he had a legitimate beef. Timmons came up the line and spoke to Kellogg, and the call was reversed. Mark Reynolds spiked his glove in anger (and appeared to utter a \xe2\x80\x9cmagic word\xe2\x80\x9d in the process) and was promptly ejected by second base umpire Vic Carapazza. Buck Showalter came out to protect his player and was also promptly ejected before giving a very spirited earful to the entire umpiring crew that would have made the Earl of Baltimore himself blush.Before we go any further with this, a still picture of the play (with the caption \xe2\x80\x9cOUT\xe2\x80\x9d) started spreading around some of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x9ctweeps\xe2\x80\x9d last night, clearly showing Reynolds with the ball in his glove holding the bag. So Kellogg got the call right to begin with. It was unclear as to whether or not Kellogg asked Timmons for help, or if Timmons just decided to give his two sense. However Buck Showalter addressed the fact that Reynolds should not have been ejected after the game. Throwing your glove is a minor equipment fine, therefore the fact that he was \xe2\x80\x9crun\xe2\x80\x9d might well have been inappropriate. Nevertheless, umpires can eject players (and coaches) at their own discretion if they feel that insubordination occurred. Obviously Carapazza felt that whatever Reynolds said combined with him throwing his glove warranted an ejection. However needless to say, I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen people NOT\xc2\xa0thrown out of games for doing much more than that.Showalter appeared angry about the way the call was overturned, but moreso about the ejection of Mark Reynolds. Here\xe2\x80\x99s another thing; the umpires were visibly shoving Showalter back towards the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 dugout throughout the entire discussion. To me that comes across as incredibly unprofessional on the part of the umps. However the fact is that Tim Timmons overturned a correct call that was made by the umpire on the spot. So to me, the entire argument was justified on the part of the Orioles. And I\xe2\x80\x99d also like to hear the league\xe2\x80\x99s explanation for why the umpires were allowed to put their hands all over Buck Showalter.Incidentally, Peralta was caught stealing so the run he represented never scored. But the Orioles lost the services of their manager as well as a bat that\xe2\x80\x99s heating up right now in the lineup. (Joe Mahoney, Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99 replacement, went 0-for-1.) And here\xe2\x80\x99s another problem that will come up in a couple of days; Reynolds will most likely be suspended. He made some pretty scathing comments about the umpiring after the game, and MLB generally takes notice of that. This will leave the Orioles a roster spot down in a few games whenever it happens.Again, the O\xe2\x80\x99s definitely got the short end of some shaddy umpiring last night. However I think the worst thing that happened was that it threw the team off it\xe2\x80\x99s game to the point that they lost some focus. That can\xe2\x80\x99t be allowed to happen to a team in a pennant race. You have to overcome bad calls, not let them overcome you. Zach Britton will return to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 rotation after a stint in the minors to make tonight\xe2\x80\x99s start, and Detroit will counter with Rick Porcello. Over his last seven starts, Porcello\xe2\x80\x99s ERA is 5.40, so hopefully the O\xe2\x80\x99s can put up some runs against him tonight. They\xe2\x80\x99ll need to do that in order to win.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com'), ('Orioles-Tigers Preview - yahoo.com', 'Buoyed by their dominant play at home, the Detroit Tigers have been the best team in the American League for nearly two months.A few more wins and they could be the best team in the AL Central very shortly.Detroit seeks a fourth straight victory overall and fourth in five games this season against the Baltimore Orioles on Saturday night.One of baseball\'s most disappointing teams for much of this season, the Tigers (64-55) are looking more and more like the club most believed they would be.No AL team has been better since June 28 than Detroit, which has won 28 of 44 during that span to pull within 1 1/2 games of Central-leading Chicago.

(AP Photo/Duane Burleson)MoreDETROIT (AP) -- Down by five after one inning and facing one of the AL's hottest pitchers, the Baltimore Orioles had the Detroit Tigers right where they wanted them.Nate McLouth hit a go-ahead, two-run triple and Baltimore stormed back to beat Detroit 7-5 on Sunday. The Orioles have rallied from five-run deficits to win three times in their last 20 games.''That's a great win for us,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''This is a very workman-like team. They don't get excited when something like this happens. They just look at what they've got in front of them and start working on it.''McLouth, Nick Markakis and Mark Reynolds each had two hits for the Orioles, who have won five of seven, including the last two of the key weekend series at Detroit. Chris Davis homered for the second straight game and J.J. Hardy had a two-run double.The Orioles lead Detroit by two games in the race for the second wild-card spot in the American League. The Tigers had won 17 of 20 at Comerica Park before dropping the last two this weekend.''That's a very good team, and you know they feed off the emotions of that crowd,'' Showalter said.

That knocked Fister out of the game, having allowed as many earned runs as his previous five starts combined.''We was just out of whack - he wasn't good today,'' Leyland said. ''He knows what to do with a lead, but he just wasn't crisp. I just don't think he felt right.''Fister allowed eight hits, struck out six and walked three.

Usually by this time of year the Birds are long since out of  contention, flailing their way to another lost season.Not  this year. Not this team. We don\'t yet know how this season will  ultimately play out, but this is the most fun we fans have had watching  an Orioles ballclub in a decade and a half. Today\'s great comeback was  another triumph for an O\'s team looking to achieve something that seemed  impossible four months ago: a seat at the postseason table.When  you win a game despite your most reliable starting pitcher getting  torched for five runs in the first inning, that\'s saying something. For  whatever reason, Wei-Yin Chen has a case of the Mondays in the opening  frame; coming into this game, he\'d allowed 14 runs (including four  homers) in the first inning this season. Those stats took another huge  hit today. Just two batters into the game, Chen coughed up a solo homer  to Omar Infante. Then-- like most pitchers-- he couldn\'t get through the  Miguel Cabrera/Prince Fielder tandem unscathed, allowing them both to  reach on a walk and a single, respectively. Before I could comment,  ""Well, at least he didn\'t let those two hit any homeruns!"", the next  batter did the honors, with Jhonny Peralta clubbing a three-run shot to  right-center field. Just five batters into the game, it was 4-0 Tigers. It  marked the second time in his last three starts that Chen allowed both a  solo homer and a three-run shot in the first inning (the Royals did it  to him two outings ago). But the Tigers weren\'t done. Delmon Young singled and then scored on a Jeff Baker RBI double to the gap. It was  now a five-run game, Chen looked completely lost, and long reliever  Steve Johnson was warming up fast in the bullpen. Wei-Yin ultimately got  the final two outs, but not before he\'d faced all nine Tigers batters  and struggled through a whopping 41 pitches. Well,  that\'ll do it. A 5-0 deficit for the Orioles against Tigers starter  Doug Fister, a pitcher who\'d rattled off seven straight quality starts  and always throws well against the Birds? That\'s it, this game is over.  Drive home safely and enjoy the rest of your Sunday afternoon.Not so fast, everyone. That\'s when things got good.The  Orioles immediately pounded their way back into the game. The comeback  began when Chris Davis led off the second with another opposite-field  homerun, his 20th of the year. Mark Reynolds followed with a duck-snort  single to center field, though Fister retired the next two hitters and  only needed to put away the sub-.100-hitting Taylor Teagarden to finish  the frame. He didn\'t. Teagarden extended the inning with a walk, turning  the lineup over for Nick Markakis, who lashed a double to left-center  to plate Reynolds.Up  next was J.J. Hardy, who celebrated his 30th birthday by ripping a  two-run double into the left-field corner, shaving the Tigers\' lead to  5-4. You can\'t keep a good Orioles team down, folks! Fister got the last  out of the inning with the lead still intact, but it only lasted two  more innings.The  Birds completed their comeback with a two-out rally in the fourth.  After Fister fanned the first two batters, Markakis drew a walk. Then,  Fister dropped a beautiful 3-2 curveball on Hardy that-- frankly--  looked like a clear strike three. But umpire Vic Carapazza ruled it ball  four, earning an ""Are you [bleeping] kidding me"" stare from Fister. I\'d  like to think it was a makeup call from Carapazza after he and his  fellow umps so thoroughly botched the first game of the series.The  O\'s still had life, and Nate McLouth took advantage, driving an 0-2  pitch all the way to the wall in right-center field. Markakis scored the  tying run, Hardy scored the go-ahead run, and McLouth cruised to third  with a standup triple. Ladies and gentlemen, the O\'s now have the lead.Adam  Jones made it a 7-5 game with an RBI single to right, which chased  Fister from the game. In just 3 \xe2\x85\x94 innings, he was tagged for seven runs.  With 12 runs on the board between the two teams in just  three-and-a-half innings of play, this game was shaping up to be a  slugfest. Yet, as it turned out, not a single run was scored for the  rest of the game.For  that, we can credit an impressive recovery by Chen. Even after he ended  that disastrous first inning, he wasn\'t out of the woods-- he struggled  again in the second, with the Tigers putting two men on base for the  dangerous Fielder. With Johnson warming up again, it\'s very possible  that Wei-Yin wouldn\'t have lasted another batter if he allowed Prince to  reach. It\'s good news, then, that Chen got Fielder to bounce into a  double play, quashing the rally and giving Wei-Yin new life.Chen  ultimately gutted it out through the fifth, and his final three innings  were the smoothest; he allowed only one baserunner in that span. Though  his final numbers aren\'t pretty-- five runs and seven hits in five  innings, with 101 pitches-- he bounced back very nicely after one  atrocious frame. And he left with a lead, putting him in line to become  the Orioles\' first 12-game winner since 2007...assuming the O\'s  relievers could hold the two-run advantage.Of  course they could, because they are awesome. After Luis Ayala worked a  scoreless sixth, Darren O\'Day pulled off the greatest escape of the day  in the seventh. Austin Jackson led off with a single. Infante followed  with a grounder to short; Hardy flipped to second for what should\'ve  been a forceout, but Omar Quintanilla somehow dropped the ball.  Literally and figuratively. The error put two runners aboard with nobody  out...and coming up next were Cabrera and Fielder. Agh! This is where  it all falls apart! We\'re doomed!Relax.  Darren\'s got this. First, he absolutely dominated Cabrera. First pitch:  slider, called strike. Second pitch: slider, called strike. Third  pitch: slider, called strike. Wow! A three-pitch strikeout, with Miguel  staring helplessly at all three. You never see that from Cabrera. It\'s a  thing of beauty. Buck Showalter elected to let O\'Day face Fielder  instead of bringing in lefty specialist J.C. Romero, who coughed up the  game-losing homer to Prince on Friday. Buck made an excellent choice  here, because O\'Day got Fielder to bounce to second, where Quintanilla  started an inning-ending, jam-escaping double play. Pitching 101!Showalter  was impressed enough by O\'Day that he let him start the eighth inning  instead of turning to setup man Pedro Strop. Darren got the first out  but was pulled after plunking Young, and Strop took over from there with  a fly to right and a strikeout to strand the runner.The  O\'s were three outs away from one of their most impressive victories of  the year, and Jim Johnson made things quick in the ninth, retiring the  Tigers 1-2-3 to leave Cabrera stranded on deck. Game: won. Series: won.  And the Birds pulled a game ahead of Detroit for a wild-card slot.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

I know that some of you have already embraced it but, well, I've been burned before. It's hard for me to trust! Since I've been scoreboard watching on my own for a few weeks now, I thought it'd be nice to have a regular update of how our foes are doing and who they'll be facing in the week ahead. For more on each team and what they have going for them, check out the Camden Cast. Going into tonight's series against the Texas Rangers, the Orioles have a record of 66-55, which is good for third in the A.L. East as well as one of the two Wild Card spots. But what about the competition? New York Yankees Record: 72-491st place, AL East, 6 games ahead of the Orioles The big talk around here is that the Orioles are in contention for the wild card, and that's awesome. It also seems like a foregone conclusion that the Yankees have locked up the A.L. East, but if we're going to believe in this team, let's BELIEVE in this team. The Orioles and Yankees go head-to-head seven more times this season, so if the good guys can just keep pace until then, then who knows what might happen.    If you turned on a TV this weekend, you probably saw that the Yankees were playing the Red Sox. As you would expect considering the way the Red Sox play the game of baseball in 2012, the Yankees won the series, taking two out of three. That didn't allow the Orioles to gain any ground. Red Sox can't do anything right.    Beginning tonight, the Yankees play the White Sox for three games. The White Sox, of course, are another team we want to lose, but for the next three days we should root for them to beat the Yankees. After that the Yankees will spend the weekend playing the Cleveland Indians, from whom the Orioles should expect no help at all. Tampa Bay RaysRecord: 67-542nd Place, AL East, 1 game ahead of the Orioles1st AL Wild Card Spot  The Rays spent the weekend sweeping a four-game series from the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, gaining two games on both the Orioles and the Yankees in the process. They've been red hot lately, having gone 8-2 in their last ten games.    This week the Rays have a six-game homestand with three each against the Kansas City Royals and Oakland Athletics. So that's three games against a last-place team and three games against another team that the Orioles are competing for a WC spot with. Go Royals! (And A's, although my heart isn't totally in it). Oakland AthleticsRecord: 65-552nd Place, AL West, 5 games behind the Texas Rangers3rd Place, AL Wild Card,  0.5 games behind the Orioles The Athletics and Orioles have the same number of losses, with the O's tallying just one more win. The surprising A's swept the Indians this weekend (see? They give us no help) and get another cake walk over the next three days as they take on the Minnesota Twins at home. We normally won't be rooting for the A's to win, but as I mentioned above, they play the Rays this coming weekend, so let's root, root, root for the A's. Chicago White SoxRecord: 65-551st Place, AL Central, 1.5 games ahead of the Detroit Tigers The White Sox aren't technically in the Wild Card race, but since they're only a game and a half ahead of the Tigers in the AL Central, they could be if the Tigers catch them. The White Sox just got swept by the Royals and almost no-hit by Jeremy Guthrie, so they had a bad weekend. Luckily for them the Tigers couldn't gain much ground thanks to two losses to the Orioles. Hopefully the White Soxgot the losing out of their system as they start a series tonight with the Yankees. Come on, White Sox, do us a solid! (I do not understand that saying) After the Yankees, the White Sox will spend the weekend with the last-place Seattle Mariners. Detroit TigersRecord: 64-572ndPlace, AL Central, 1.5 games behind the White Sox4th Place, AL Wild Card, 2 games behind the Orioles After losing two of three to our Orioles this past weekend, the Tigers have a day off today before playing the Toronto Blue Jays at home for three games, followed by three against the Angels. The Blue Jays have been pretty crappy lately, but hopefully they can get their act together and help out their AL East brethren. Depending on how the first part of the week goes, if the Tigers sweep the Angels next weekend, they could essentially eliminate the them from contention. Los Angeles Angels of AnaheimRecord: 62-603rd Place, AL West, 9 games behind the Rangers5th Place, AL Wild Card, 4.5 games behind the Orioles It was a rough weekend for the Angels, who lost four straight to the Rays despite their good on-paper team. They're off tonight as they travel to the east coast where they'll have the joy of playing the Red Sox. If they can't manage success against the lowly Sox they should probably just call it a day because their trip to Detroit isn't going to be any easier. I'm hoping at as the season goes on we'll be able to drop a few teams from this list, and the while the Angels certainly seem like they might be the first to go due to their record, I won't count out their team until they're dead. They have the talent to go on a pretty great run, and I have my fingers crossed that it won't happen.

That\xe2\x80\x99s the mark of a good team; finding a way to lose is the mark of a poor one.The Orioles certainly found a way to win yesterday, and in surprising fashion at that.

Davis couldn\xe2\x80\x99t produce a salami, however that was only due to the fact that he led off the second inning. Davis promptly sent one over the wall, and the comeback was suddenly on.To re-use a term above, when the smoke cleared\xc2\xa0the O\xe2\x80\x99s had put four runs on the board in the second. Nick Markakis doubled home Omar Quintanilla, and later scored on J.J. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI double.

We\xe2\x80\x99ve said this so many times: the Orioles quite simply don\xe2\x80\x99t give up. This is a lesson that was hammered home to them last September as you might recall, and it\xe2\x80\x99s a good life lesson for the record. Markakis and Hardy scored once again in the fourth on Nate McClouth\xe2\x80\x99s two-RBI triple as the Orioles seized the lead. When all was said and done, the Birds put up seven unanswered runs on the home standing Detroit Tigers, winning the game and the series.I mentioned the five-run comeback in NY above; Wei-Yin Chen had a similar day to Chris Tillman in that game. Chen\xe2\x80\x99s final line: 5 IP, 7 H, 5 R, 2 BB, 4 K. He was able to settled down after his team put him back into the game. In that first inning if you had told me that Chen would have outlasted Detroit starter Doug Fister, I would have probably been surprised. However I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure why I would have been surprised, given this team\xe2\x80\x99s propensity for coming back and fighting to the end. We all seem to need a reminder every now and again that we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about the\xc2\xa0Fighting Showalters.The comparisons between this team and the 1989 Orioles are obviously front and center; that version of the Orioles was titled the \xe2\x80\x9cWhy Not\xc2\xa0Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9d They had low expectations, and they contended for the playoffs into the final weekend before falling just short. Why Not\xc2\xa0is a popular phrase around Baltimore again in 2012, however I don\xe2\x80\x99t think it should be. In 1989 the Orioles weren\xe2\x80\x99t that far removed from the franchise\xe2\x80\x99s glory years; after all, they had just won the World Series six years prior in 1983, and they had been in the World Series ten years prior in 1979. All of that was still fresh in the minds of Oriole fans.Incidentally, the Orioles need 15 wins to reach 81 for the season. If they only won 15 more games, they would finish the season at .500 which would at the very least snap the 14 straight years of losing seasons. That\xe2\x80\x99s a pretty big deal for a franchise that\xe2\x80\x99s trying to re-establish itself as \xe2\x80\x9cgood.\xe2\x80\x9d In the middle of the 2007 campaign owner Peter Angelos hired Andy MacPhail to be the President of Baseball Operations for the franchise. At that time I said that we\xe2\x80\x99d look back at that season as the time when the winds of change began to blow through the yard. MacPhail aquired Adam Jones and Chris Tillman via trade, and made numerous other moves that have had positive ripple effects in the present day.MacPhail is now gone, however it appears that the two-headed attack of Showalter and Dan Duquette has taken what MacPhail left and almost perfected it. That\xe2\x80\x99s not to say that this team is perfect, because we all know that\xe2\x80\x99s not the case. However it seems that everything they\xe2\x80\x99ve done has turned to gold, whereas the moves of past incarnations of the Orioles have all turned to stone. Duquette and Showalter have created a competitive atmosphere that holds players accountable if they don\xe2\x80\x99t produce, but also a team atmosphere where guys feel comfortable with each other. That\xe2\x80\x99s making a world of difference.Courtesy of the Baltimore SunI feel that this season could in a way be more special to Oriole fans than the \xe2\x80\x9989 campaign because of the struggles over the past 14 years. For the purposes of this piece, it\xe2\x80\x99s really irrelevant whether or not the Birds make the playoffs. Certainly that\xe2\x80\x99s the goal and that\xe2\x80\x99s what the players, coaches, and fans (not to mention a certain writer!) are focusing on, however I suppose what I\xe2\x80\x99m saying is that the Orioles are proving a point this year regardless of the standings.This franchise is\xc2\xa0paying homage to the roots of the orange and black, and \xc2\xa0proving that the old Oriole Way isn\xe2\x80\x99t quite as dead as teams such as Boston and New York want people to believe. Therefore I submit that the 2012 Orioles should not be known as a \xe2\x80\x9csecond incarnaton\xe2\x80\x9d of the\xc2\xa0why not\xc2\xa0team. This is much different from that campaign, and in my view much more important. So let them be known forever in history as the Return to Glory Orioles. While we don\xe2\x80\x99t know what the future holds, if 2007 brought the winds of change, we\xe2\x80\x99ll look back at 2012 as the year that a great franchise returned to it\xe2\x80\x99s former glory.Follow me on Twitter @DomenicVadala ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

But late Tuesday night, after another poor outing by Ivan Nova, Manager Joe Girardi acknowledged that Nova\xe2\x80\x99s problems had now endured for a significant period of time. But he bristled at questions about how much longer the Yankees could stick with Nova, their struggling right-hander.Girardi and the Yankees have a reason to be concerned, and perhaps even a little tense. Nova allowed six runs, including a tiebreaking grand slam to Kevin Youkilis in the fifth inning in a 7-3 loss to the Chicago White Sox.The Tampa Bay Rays, who have been closing the gap in the East race, lost on Tuesday to remain four games back of the Yankees. But the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 pitching is not as secure as it once seemed with Andy Pettitte and C. C. Sabathia out with injuries, and Phil Hughes, Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s starter, having his own troubles with inconsistency.Sabathia threw in the bullpen Tuesday afternoon and proclaimed himself ready to come off the disabled list, perhaps as soon as Friday. It had been assumed that his replacement, David Phelps, would relinquish his spot to make room. But after Tuesday, Nova is 1-4 with a 7.28 earned run average in his last eight starts since the All-Star break, prompting questions about whether he, and not Phelps, should come out of the rotation. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Girardi never guaranteed that Nova would keep his spot.\xe2\x80\x9cWe haven\xe2\x80\x99t talked about what we\xe2\x80\x99re going to do,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said with a shrug. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re not that far along. I have to wait to make sure C. C. is O.K. tomorrow before we make any decisions.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  When asked if he would consider leaving Phelps in the rotation, Girardi quickly responded: \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not there. You guys know I won\xe2\x80\x99t talk about it two minutes after the game. I know you have to ask.\xe2\x80\x9dHe was then asked, regardless of Phelps, if Nova\xe2\x80\x99s spot was still secure.\xe2\x80\x9cYou can ask it another way,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cOur plan is to have him start, and we\xe2\x80\x99ll see what happens.\xe2\x80\x9dGirardi said the biggest issue for Nova had been the location of his pitches, especially his fastball, which too often has been tantalizingly high in the zone. With the score tied, 2-2 in the fifth, he threw a 95-mile-per-hour fastball straight down the middle and belt high to Youkilis, who drove it over the right-field wall for his third career grand slam and second of the season.

There was no one on base when Alex Rios\xe2\x80\x99s led off the second with a triple, or when Alexei Ramirez doubled with one out in the fifth.Catcher Russell Martin, who homered along with Derek Jeter, noted that Nova had never been a pitcher who relied on pinpoint control.

(AP Photo/Jim Cowsert)MoreARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Ryan Dempster had some extra rest and a slider that was working.This was more like the kind of performance from Dempster the AL West-leading Rangers were looking for when they traded for the right-hander three weeks ago.After giving up eight runs twice in his first three Texas starts, Dempster limited the surprising Baltimore Orioles to a first-inning run and allowed only four hits over eight innings in a 5-1 victory Monday night.''I was able to settle down after the first inning and just make pitches. I had a good slider,'' Dempster said. ''I hadn't had that the couple times I've been here.''Dempster (2-1 in Texas, 7-6 overall) was pitching on extra rest after missing the weekend series in his native Canada for personal reasons. While he wasn't with the Rangers for the three games in Toronto and missed his scheduled start Saturday, he threw a bullpen session over the weekend.In his 16 starts for the Cubs before the July 31 trade, Dempster had a 2.25 ERA and pitched eight innings twice. The last time was June 10 at Minnesota. He had an 8.31 ERA his first three starts for the Rangers.''He's got a track record of a good pitcher. Those are the types of things guys like him are capable of doing,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Obviously, he's a great addition for them. We did what we could do. Didn't hit many balls hard off of him. He kept the ball off the center of the plate. We ran into a pretty good pitcher.''Dempster retired the last 11 batters he faced before closer Joe Nathan, in a non-save situation, struck out the side in the ninth.David Murphy had two RBI singles for the Rangers, who opened a 10-game homestand. All nine Texas starters had a hit.Miguel Gonzalez (5-3), who had won his previous three decisions, gave up four runs in five innings.Dempster needed only three pitches to get the first two Baltimore batters out before Nate McLouth doubled and scored on Adam Jones' soft single. That was the only run the Orioles got.Only two runners reached second base against Dempster after that, and the last Baltimore batter to reach was Nick Markakis with a one-out single in the fifth. Dempster struck out six and walked two while throwing 111 pitches.''He kept the ball down, had a good slider going, good changeup, good sinker, got ahead. That's what he's capable of doing,'' Rangers manager Ron Washington said. ''He's not an overpowering guy. He has to execute his pitches, and tonight he executed. As long as he executes them, he's going to be fine.''The Orioles, who are in the hunt for one of the AL's two wildcard spots, lost for only the fifth time their last 16 games.The Rangers took the lead for good with three runs in the fourth.Gonzalez, who had won three consecutive decisions, gave up hits to the first two batters he faced. But the right-hander couldn't get out of a similar jam in the fourth.Adrian Beltre had a leadoff single before Nelson Cruz walked. Murphy blooped a one-out single to left to tie the game at 1. Geovany Soto, who also came to Texas from the Cubs last month, followed with an RBI single before Mitch Moreland reached on an infield single. Ian Kinsler hit a sacrifice fly to make it 3-1.''I thought Miguel was good. I thought he deserved a better fate. The game's not always fair,'' Showalter said. ''Dempster was just a little better. There's not a whole lot there to talk about. Their guy pitched well.''Kinsler walked twice and was 1 for 2, but still had only six hits in 48 at-bats over his last 13 games.Josh Hamilton led off the fifth with a single and scored on a double by Cruz. Murphy added another run-scoring single in the eighth.''It's fun to play games like this,'' Murphy said. ''We got a great performance out of Ryan Dempster. That's exactly the type of guy he is. He pounded the strike zone, but once we got him a little bit more of a lead, you could tell that he did it even more so.''Notes: Orioles 1B/DH Jim Thome, out since July 27 with a herniated disk in his neck, will start swinging off a tee and in the cages this week. Showalter says Thome will start his rehab Wednesday in Sarasota, Fla. ... Rangers SS Elvis Andrus had a standout defensive play in the fifth when he made a backhanded stop deep in the hole and threw out Manny Manchado at first base. ... Jones had two singles but is homerless in 88 at-bats. ... Markakis was 1 for 3 with a walk and is hitting .333 in 37 games as Baltimore's leadoff hitter. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

Nate McLouth!', "" The Orioles tonight combined a great game by starting pitcher Chris Tillman with a big inning in which the offense scored four runs to take the second game in their series with the Texas Rangers. The win guarantees them a 3-3 record on their road trip through Detroit and Texas and gives them the opportunity to take the series tomorrow night. Nate McLouth, the inexplicable #3 hitter for the Orioles, manufactured the team a run in the top of the first inning. With two outs he worked Rangers' starter Scott Feldman for a six-pitch walk, then stole second and moved to third when Geovany Soto threw the ball into center field. That put him in the perfect spot to score when Feldman threw a wild pitch with Adam Jones at the plate. McLouth scored standing up, giving the Orioles their first run without even getting a hit. Well done, Nate! And stay tuned for later in the recap when he does something even better.  Tillman held that one-run lead for awhile, but you know that's not going to be enough to top the Texas Rangers. After facing just seven batters through two innings (a single by Adrian Beltre the only blemish), Tillman started the third inning with two quick outs before that pest Ian Kinsler hit a ball to left field that just barely left the park for a solo home run.  After a very quick fourth inning in which Feldman struck out Adam Jones, Matt Wieters, and Chris Davis, the Orioles knocked Feldman around to the tune of four runs, beginning with a leadoff opposite field single by Mark Reynolds. Reynolds was replaced on the bases by Omar Quintanilla after a force out, and so it was Quintanilla who came around to score the go-ahead run on Manny Machado's triple that went past Josh Hamilton in center field. Just his 12th big-league game and he already has two triples? Nice.     Nick Markakis was no help to this rally, grounding out to the pitcher on the first pitch that he saw, but J.J. Hardy saved the day with a double to right field that easily scored Machado and put Hardy in scoring position for McLouth. Well, it turns out that Hardy didn't need to be in scoring position, because McLouth hit a no-doubt-about-it home run to right field to knock himself and Hardy in and make the score 5-1. It was a nice night for McLouth, for sure.     After the Rangers scored in the third, Tillman bounced back with three scoreless, allowing exactly one baserunner in each of the fourth, fifth, and sixth innings. He started the seventh inning with a four-run lead and a manageable pitch count, but he wouldn't be able to finish it. After a one-out single to David Murphy, Soto came to the plate and hit a two-run homer to almost the same place that Kinsler had earlier in the game. That cut the Orioles lead to two at 5-3, but Tillman followed up the homer with a strikeout to Mitch Moreland. Strike three was one of of the most beautiful curve balls a person could hope to see, and Moreland swung through it helplessly.  Despite that great pitch, Tillman's night was over as Kinsler came to the plate. He was replaced by Darren O'Day who had an uncharacteristically bad night. He walked Kinsler and then gave up a single to Elvis Andrus, forcing Buck Showalter to go to Pedro Strop one out earlier than normal.     Strop came in to face the dangerous Josh Hamilton and immediately went to 2-0 on him. With the count 3-1, Strop threw a slider that ended up very low and inside and Hamilton swung through it for strike two. He came back with another slider, but this one stayed up and Hamilton crushed it. It went a mile, but thankfully it was foul. So what do Strop and Wieters do? Come back with another slider that was close to Hamilton's feet, easily ball four if Hamilton could resist swinging. He couldn't, though. and that was strike three. Awesome.   via www.brooksbaseball.net I haven't mentioned the Orioles hitting since the fifth inning because after the fifth inning, the offense was non-existent. They knocked Feldman out of the game after five innings, but three Rangers relievers combined to pitch three innings in which the only baserunner was on an infield single by Adam Jones in the eighth inning. It wasn't much of a single either, as it died in the infield grass without the Rangers being able to make a play.  Thankfully they didn't need any more runs. After his masterful strikeout of Josh Hamilton, Strop came back and pitched a scoreless eighth inning, giving up a one-out walk to Nelson Cruz. And Orioles closer Jim Johnson shut it down in the ninth with three easy outs. JJ being JJ.  O's win, 5-3! And the good news is that the Yankees and Rays also lost tonight, bringing the Orioles within one game of the Rays and just five behind the Yankees. August baseball!

(AP Photo/Jim Cowsert)MoreARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Chris Tillman's success against the potent Rangers offense is no longer a secret. And his methods aren't really either.Nate McLouth hit a two-run home run in the Orioles' decisive four-run fifth inning of a 5-3 victory against Texas on Tuesday night, and the Baltimore right-hander kept Rangers hitters off-balance with effective off-speed pitches and good command of his fastball.Tillman worked 6 2/3 innings, giving up three runs on six hits while striking out seven before giving way to the bullpen, which now has a 1.57 ERA in the last 18 games.That follows a performance two years ago in which Tillman held the Rangers to two runs on two hits and a walk over a career-high 7 1/3 innings.''It ain't easy,'' said Tillman, who improved to 6-2 on the season with a 3.71 ERA and 4-1 on the road.''These guys have a great lineup and you have to respect that whether you're ahead or behind.''Manny Machado had a run-scoring triple and J.J. Hardy's two-out double in the fifth plated another run in the fifth, which was followed with two shutdown innings by Tillman.Jim Johnson worked a scoreless ninth to pick up his 38th save.''Chris was good,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''He had command of the breaking ball early, and threw the fastball on both sides of the plate.''The Rangers scored two on Geovany Soto's two-run homer in the seventh inning to close a 5-1 deficit to two and then put the tying run on base, but Pedro Strop struck out Josh Hamilton on a slider to end the threat.David Murphy, 10 for 19 with a homer and three doubles and six RBI in his previous five games, went 1 for 4 on Tuesday, including a groundout with a runner on base to end the Rangers' half of the eighth.''Pedy got a couple of big outs for us,'' Showalter said. The bullpen ''has been a constant for us. We've been able to share the load and pass it around.''We've got a lot of people we have confidence in.''Scott Feldman, who won six consecutive decisions in May and June, surrendered five runs - including four earned, though that run scored on a wild pitch - on seven hits in five innings in losing his third in a row.He struck out four and walked one while ending a string of good performances by Rangers pitching, which entered Tuesday having allowed two runs or less in three consecutive games and just four total in the three-game winning streak.The starting rotation had posted a 2.96 ERA in the previous seven games.''I thought he made a real good pitch to Hardy and he went down and poked it to right field,'' Rangers manager Ron Washington said of Feldman. ''I think if there's any pitch he'd want to take back in that inning, it would be the one to McLouth, but other than that, there was no indication they were going to put four runs on the board because both he and Tillman were pitching very well.''The AL West-division leading Rangers lost a game to Los Angeles in the standings and lead the Angels by eight games. Oakland, which started the evening six back, were playing late at home against Minnesota.The Orioles broke loose for four runs in the fifth. Machado's triple scored Omar Quintanilla and McLouth sent a Feldman pitch into the left-field seats for a two-run home run that made the score 5-1.''All you're trying to do in that situation is limit the damage,'' Feldman said. ''Even after giving up that hit to Hardy, we're still in the game. I just made a bad pitch to McLouth.''The Rangers' Ian Kinsler hit his 14th home run of the season to tie the game in the third on a 1-0 pitch.The Orioles took a first-inning lead by scoring an unearned run with two outs.McLouth walked, stole second and advanced to third on an error when Soto's throw sailed into center field. He scored on Feldman's wild pitch.Notes: Entering the game, three of the top 22 qualifiers in ERA as relievers in the AL were Orioles. Pedro Strop (2nd, 1.49), Darren O'Day (17th, 2.49) and Troy Patton (22nd, 2.58). . The Rangers' Adrian Beltre, hitting .235 in his previous 30 games, went 2 for 4 on Tuesday. . The Orioles have won 12 consecutive one-run games. The franchise has done that on three other occasions, 1964, 1970 and 1979. Baltimore went to the World Series in 1970 and '79 and won 97 games and finished two games back of eventual World Series champion New York Yankees in '64. . Rangers reliever Michael Kirkman extended a scoreless innings streak to seven in his last six games after holding the Orioles to no runs in two innings. Kirkman also has stranded 11 of the last 13 inherited runners, including three in a game three times. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

Furthermore, the Baltimore Orioles as a staff probably had no urge to give up four home runs in the entire game, three of which were surrendered by Hunter. Texas seems to consistently be a thorn in the Orioles side in some way, just as the Orioles appear to be chicken soup (or at least broth) to all of Texas\xe2\x80\x99 ailments. History shows this more than anything else; five years ago yesterday Texas soundly defeated the Orioles 30-3 in the first game of a twin bill at the yard. (They would follow that up by winning the second game 9-7.) The Orioles of course surrendered four homers to Josh Hamilton at Camden Yards earlier this year on one game, and now last night Adrian Beltre hammered three home runs against the Birds.

It\xe2\x80\x99s that simple.\xe2\x80\x9d That\xe2\x80\x99s about it in a nutshell I would say. Many critics and/or \xe2\x80\x9cnon-believers\xe2\x80\x9d in the Orioles are starting to laugh when writers such as myself consistently bring up the fact that they \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t quit.\xe2\x80\x9d That was still true last night, even after surrendering a nine-run fourth inning. The Birds came back and put across two more runs. Even a team with no quit is going to have a difficult time coming back from a nine-run inning, however those two runs are symbolic moreso than anything else. Had the Orioles \xe2\x80\x9cquit\xe2\x80\x9d on themselves last night the final score would have been 12-1. What\xe2\x80\x99s the difference between 12-1 and 12-3 you might ask? Very little, but it does kind of say these colors don\xe2\x80\x99t run in a way.Again, detractors are going to say that not giving up means nothing if you don\xe2\x80\x99t win. I disagree. If a team doesn\xe2\x80\x99t give up facing an eight-run deficet, they probably won\xe2\x80\x99t give up down by one in the 9th. It\xe2\x80\x99s a mindset more than anything else, and the Orioles have examplified it with precision in 2012. I do feel that it\xe2\x80\x99ll be interesting to see what happens with Tommy Hunter once Jason Hammel returns to the rotation. Quite frankly as inconsistent as he\xe2\x80\x99s been I would hate to think that he\xe2\x80\x99s not on the roster on September 1st, which is the cut off for people to be on playoff rosters. Yes, that\xe2\x80\x99s an issue for the Orioles this year. Hunter needs to keep the ball down and cut down on the home run balls, but we have also seen him be very good at this level in 2012.I\xe2\x80\x99m thinking that the Birds will probably make at least one roster move before tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s game with Toronto, as Friday and Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s starters are currently listed as TBD. (Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s scheduled starter is Chris Tillman.) With an off day today the O\xe2\x80\x99s can manipulate the rotation a bit so that guys remain on extra rest, however the team was also rumored to be interested in Joe Saunders, who was waived by Arizona this week. Could Saunders be headed to Baltimore? The Orioles might not have to give up too much to get him, however it\xe2\x80\x99s also a matter of whether or not he\xe2\x80\x99s the right fit for the team.

He struck out five and walked three.Hunter (4-8) allowed eight runs on eight hits - three home runs - in three-plus innings.

''I've been working in the cages trying to find a comfort zone with my feet and hands.''The last three days I stuck with something,'' he added.Beltre, Murphy, Young and Ian Kinsler each had more than one hit. Shortstop Elvis Andrus was the only starter without a hit for the Rangers, who improved to 13-8 in August and maintained a five-game lead over Oakland in the AL West.Murphy has five multihit games in his last six and is hitting .519 with four doubles, one home run and seven RBIs during the stretch.

And tonight, my mom was sitting in the stands and Chris Davis hit three home runs. She sent me a text message that said, ""3 Davis HR WooHoo!"" I mean, come on. That\'s adorable. It\'s no secret that I said some not-so-nice things about Chris Davis earlier this year. Maybe I was harsh on him. But really most of that was while he was having the ball thrown directly at him at first base and he couldn\'t seem to catch it. And I do still think that he is a very flawed player. But you know what? I love Chris Davis. He IS impressive! So that other stuff that happened tonight included Zach Britton pitching a pretty great game for the second start in a row. Zach got off to a good start right away, retiring the top of the first in order with two strikeouts. He got into trouble in the second inning, starting with a leadoff double from Edwin Encarnacion, who came around to score one batter later thanks to a single from Kelly Johnson. He got the next two batters out, but then walked Jeff Mathis. Jeff Mathis! He\'s awful, Zach. It would behoove Zach Britton to not walk crappy hitters. He got out of the inning with just one run allowed, but he was definitely shaky. The Blue Jays didn\'t hold the lead for long because the Orioles have a hitter named Chris Davis. He was up first for the Orioles in the bottom of the second and he only needed one pitch to hit Eutaw Street. Tie game! It was a moon shot for Davis.    After his rough second inning, Britton got his act together. He just did what we all know he can do: he got the hitters to hit into grounders. In the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth innings, he faced fourteen batters. Eight of them hit into ground outs. One hit a ground ball single, two struck out, one flew out, one popped out, and one was hit by a pitch. It was a thing of beauty.    You know what else is a thing of beauty? No, not Chris Davis (well, yes, Chris Davis, but not right at this moment). The infield defense. Can you even BELIEVE that I said that? But tonight, the combination of Manny Machado, J.J. Hardy, and Ryan Flaherty was really just a sight to behold. Hardy and Flaherty especially were putting on a show behind Britton. If Hardy doesn\'t win the Gold Glove this year, I\'ll...well I\'ll expect it since he hasn\'t been hitting much. But he deserves it. Back to Chris Davis. Davis stepped to the plate in the bottom of the fourth inning with the game still tied 1-1. This time there were two outs and no runners on, and on a 2-2 pitch he crushed another one. This one landed in the bleacher seats, almost all the way back. He just has such a nice swing, doesn\'t he?    The Orioles added three more runs in the sixth inning, with a few more Orioles joining in on the fun. A single by Nate McLouth and a double from Adam Jones put runners on second and third base with no outs, and Matt Wieters hit a fly ball to shallow center field that was caught by Colby Rasmus. McLouth tagged up and it would have been a really close play but Rasmus made a bad throw that went up the third base line. With Jones still on base and Davis stepping to the plate, the Blue Jays manager decided it was time to take out starting pitcher Carlos Villanueva. Makes sense, seeing as how Davis had already crushed two home runs off of him in the game. Villanueva was replaced by Steve Delabar and, well, the strategy did not work out for the Jays. This time Chris Davis went opposite field with his homer. He likes to mix it up, you know? That made the score 5-1, with four of the Orioles runs knocked in on Davis home runs. Zach Britton was going strong into the seventh inning, but at about 100 pitches he began to lose it. He got two outs, but after a walk and a single that put runners on first and third, Buck Showalter pulled him in favor of Darren O\'Day. The normally reliable O\'Day didn\'t get the job done, as Rajai Davis singled past a diving Machado at third base. The runner on second came in to score, a tough break for Britton. Things got interesting after that. With the lefty Rasmus coming to the plate, Showalter turned to the new LOOGY, Brian Matusz. Everyone was nervous, but it seems that there was no need to be. Three pitches later and Rasmus had struck out to end the inning. Huzzah, Brian Matusz! The O\'s got that run right back in the bottom of the seventh thanks to a sacrifice fly from Nick Markakis, and after another typical Pedro Strop outing (1 IP, 0 H, 1 BB, 2 K), the Orioles took a 6-2 lead into the ninth. Buck called on Matt Lindstrom to close out the game, but it didn\'t work out. Lindstrom faced only two batters, but the first singled and the second, Jeff Mathis, homered. First a walk to Mathis and now a home run? Am I the only one who knows that he\'s Jeff Mathis?? With the lead down to just two runs, Buck turned to Jim Johnson. He did his thing, recording a strikeout, a ground out, and another strike out to end the game. All in a days work for JJ. O\'s win! Tune in tomorrow night at Steve Johnson makes his second big-league start and the Orioles try to grab the series win.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Stepping to the plate with a chance to become the 17th player in baseball history to hit four home runs in a game, Chris Davis had one thing in mind.''I was thinking about trying to work a walk,'' Davis said with a wry grin.Davis didn't get that fourth homer, but three was quite enough to power the Baltimore Orioles to a 6-4 victory over the skidding Toronto Blue Jays on Friday night.Davis hit solo shots off Carlos Villanueva (6-4) in the second and fourth innings, then greeted Steve Delabar in the sixth with an opposite-field, two-run drive to left field to put Baltimore up 5-1.Facing Brad Lincoln in the eighth inning, Davis took three mighty swings but struck out on four pitches.''I was definitely thinking about the home run,'' Davis said. ''He gave me a good pitch to hit on the first pitch and I fouled it off. He was tough after that, but the biggest thing is we get the win and I enjoyed a pretty good night.''To say the least.It was the first three-homer game for Davis, whose previous high was two on May 26, 2009, against the Yankees as a member of the Texas Rangers. The three home runs gave him 23 for the season, eclipsing his previous career high of 21 in 2009.After the last one, Davis stepped out of the dugout to acknowledge the request for a curtain call by the crowd of 25,754. He's the 19th Oriole to hit three home runs in a game, the first since Nick Markakis in August 2006.''It was awesome,'' Davis said of the ovation. ''I mean, these fans have been awesome all year.''On Wednesday night, Adrian Beltre hit three homers for Texas against Baltimore. The Orioles, who were off Thursday, become the first team in major league history to be involved in two straight games in which a player homered three times, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Zach Britton (3-1) allowed two runs and four hits in 6 2-3 innings for the Orioles, who have won seven of 11 to remain in the thick of the AL wild-card race.After Jeff Mathis hit a two-run homer off Matt Lindstrom in the ninth, Jim Johnson got three outs for his 39th save.It was the sixth straight defeat for the last-place Blue Jays and their season-high seventh consecutive loss on the road. But Toronto did, at least, end a run of seven successive games without scoring more than three runs.Unfortunately for the Jays, their offensive outburst wasn't enough to overcome Davis' three long balls.''He had a good day,'' Villanueva said. ''He's capable of doing that. You make some mistakes, he did what you're supposed to do with them. Especially the last two. He won them the ballgame, simple as that.''Earlier in the day, the Blue Jays activated Jose Bautista (left wrist inflammation) from the 15-day disabled list. Playing in his first major league game since July 16, Bautista went 0 for 4 with two strikeouts.Toronto went up 1-0 in the second inning when Edwin Encarnacion doubled and came home on a single by Kelly Johnson. The Blue Jays didn't get another hit until Encarnacion singled with two outs in the sixth.Davis connected on Villanueva's first pitch in the bottom of the second. It was the 66th home run in the 21-year history of Camden Yards to land on Eutaw Street in front of the B&O Warehouse, the third hit by Davis.In the fourth, Orioles shortstop J.J. Hardy dived behind second base to make a sensational stop on a grounder by Johnson and got a force out with a backhanded flip to second.Davis homered to center on a 2-2 pitch in the fourth. His sixth-inning drive, on Delabar's second pitch, followed a sacrifice fly by Matt Wieters.Toronto's Rajai Davis doubled in a run in the seventh before Brian Matusz struck out Colby Rasmus on three pitches. It was the first relief appearance by Matusz after 68 career starts.NOTES: The Orioles recalled Matusz from Triple-A Norfolk, designated LHP J.C. Romero for assignment, activated INF Ryan Flaherty from the DL and optioned RHP Tommy Hunter to Double-A Bowie. ... Baltimore RHP Jason Hammel, (15-day DL, right knee) threw a simulated game off the mound at Camden Yards. The Orioles will check his knee for swelling Saturday before determining the next step for his return. Also, INF Wilson Betemit (right wrist) could begin a rehabilitation assignment as soon as Tuesday. ... After the game, the Blue Jays activated RHP Brandon Morrow from the DL and will start him on Saturday night. Toronto also activated Yunel Escobar from the paternity list and optioned OF Anthony Gose and SS Adeiny Hechavarria to Triple-A Las Vegas.

Screw the wild card-- let\'s go for the division title.The  Birds made it look easy tonight. A quality start, a prolific offensive  showing, and another round of scoreless innings from the bullpen. That\'s  how it\'s done.It\'s  been a hectic few weeks for Steve Johnson. The day after making his  first major-league start (which he won) on August 8, Johnson was  jettisoned to the minor leagues, then called back up a week later,  scheduled to start in Detroit, forced to pitch in relief in a blowout,  scratched from the start, stuck in bullpen purgatory, scheduled to start  against the Blue Jays, forced to pitch another relief inning three days  ago, but finally taking the mound tonight for his second big-league  start. So it\'s safe to say he wasn\'t exactly working on his normal  schedule.In  the first inning, it showed. Johnson was leaving his pitches high in  the zone, getting away with a few hangers until Edwin Encarnacion jumped  on a changeup that didn\'t change up and smashed a two-run homer to  left. It would\'ve been a three-run homer, mind you, if not for the  catching Jesus that is Matt Wieters, who threw out Mike McCoy trying to  steal a batter before. Toronto, didn\'t you get the memo? Don\'t run on  Matt Wieters.Wieters  wasn\'t done making mincemeat of Blue Jays runners. In the third inning,  Rajai Davis singled, but Wieters gunned him down at second base for his  second caught stealing. ...Seriously, Blue Jays, what did I just say? Don\'t run on Matt Wieters.Inexplicably, they tried to run again two innings later, with similarly disastrous results. Blue Jays? Are  you kidding me with this? Are you all trying to get fired or something?  In the fifth, Omar Vizquel singled. As he took his lead off first base,  Vizquel gazed longingly at second and pondered, ""Hmm...McCoy didn\'t make  it. Rajai Davis, the fastest guy on the team, didn\'t make it. But  surely I, 800-year-old Omar Vizquel, can swipe the bag!"" Spoiler alert:  He could not. In fact, after taking off for second, he stopped halfway  there when he saw how badly he was beaten by Wieters\'s throw. He was  quickly tagged out. Rack up 3 CS for Matt in five innings. It\'s  hard to decide which was worse for the Jays tonight: their baserunning  or their fielding. In the third inning, they biffed away their 2-0 lead  through defensive butchery. Toronto starter Brandon Morrow, fresh off  the DL, gave up a leadoff single to Nick Markakis. The double play  machine J.J. Hardy hit a comebacker that could\'ve been a twin killing,  but the ball tipped off Morrow\'s glove and bounded away for an infield  hit. Nate McLouth was ordered to bunt-- the less said about that  ridiculous decision, the better-- and fouled out, giving Morrow a chance  to escape with a double-play ball. That\'s exactly what he got from Adam  Jones...except that shortstop Yunel Escobar completely whiffed on the  grounder, turning a possible two outs into zero as Markakis came home to  score. Wieters followed with a game-tying sac fly.Two  innings later, the O\'s took the lead. Again the rally began with  Markakis, who singled. Hardy then swatted a deep fly to right field that  smacked the wall just a foot underneath the foul pole and only a few  inches to the fair side. Hardy was credited with a double, but the  umpires reviewed the play just to be safe. After McLouth whiffed, Jones  came up with the clutch hit, looping a single to left field to plate  both runners. 4-2 Orioles.Morrow  didn\'t make it out of the fifth inning. He left with four runs charged  to him, though only two earned. He also left without MASN broadcasters  Gary Thorne and Rick Dempsey ever figuring out how to pronounce his name  correctly. It\'s ""Morrow,"" guys. Not ""Moreau."" The accent is on the  first syllable. It\'s such an easy name, too. As you\'d imagine, they were  completely helpless when it came to pronouncing ""Encarnacion."" I think  they said it 10 different ways, none of them correct.The  Orioles piled on against Toronto\'s less-than-stellar bullpen. Hardy was  in the center of things again in the sixth, lifting a two-run homer  into the first row of the left-field seats off Chad Jenkins. It was part  of a 3-for-4 night for J.J., and if he could finally get into a  long-awaited hot streak, it would be a huge boon for the Birds down the  stretch. But let\'s see if he can keep it up against pitching staffs that  are better than Toronto\'s. Later in the sixth,  Wieters delivered an  RBI single.The  Birds completed their scoring on a Manny Machado RBI knock in the  seventh, extending their lead to 8-2. It was a great night for the  offense, as every Oriole in the lineup reached base, and all but McLouth  had at least one hit.Let\'s  get back to Steve Johnson, who settled down in a big way after the  shaky first inning. Buoyed by Wieters throwing out everyone in sight,  Johnson faced just one batter over the minimum for his final five  innings of work. Just as in his first start, Steve was surprisingly  strikeout-happy, racking up 7 Ks against a depleted Jays lineup (which  lost Jose Bautista after the first inning, as he re-aggravated the sore  wrist that kept him on the DL for a month). I don\'t know quite how  Johnson does it, since his stuff isn\'t overpowering, but he just gets  people out. Looks like he\'s staked his claim on a rotation spot for the  near future.Luis  Ayala worked two scoreless innings of relief, and as the skies opened  over Camden Yards, Kevin Gregg struck out the side (!) in the ninth  inning to quash any thoughts of a rain delay. Put another victory in the  books for the Birds, who have now matched last year\'s win total.     ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

Toronto is 14 games under .500 for the first time since Sept. 25, 2009.Winning for only the second time in 12 tries may be tougher without Bautista, who is back on the disabled list with discomfort in his left wrist. He left Saturday\'s game in the third inning after missing nearly six weeks with the same injury before returning in the opener of this series.""I\'ve been playing with it and I\'ve been fine,"" said Bautista, the reigning two-time AL home run champion. ""That\'s why it is a little bizarre to me.""Bautista\'s absence may be a relief to Chris Tillman (6-2, 3.71 ERA), who has allowed him to go 4 for 9 with two homers.The right-hander is 1-2 with a 4.45 ERA in five starts against Toronto, but won the only meeting at home Aug. 6, 2011, yielding two runs in seven innings.Tillman, though, hasn\'t been sharp in his last four starts at home, going 2-1 with a 4.56 ERA - 7.84 in his past two games. However, he was impressive in Tuesday\'s 5-3 win at Texas, allowing three runs with seven strikeouts in 6 2-3 innings.Henderson Alvarez (7-11, 4.84) will try to end Toronto\'s skid as well as his own. The right-hander is 0-4 with a 7.29 ERA in four starts this month since beating Detroit on July 28.Unlike Tillman\'s most recent outing, Alvarez was battered by the Rangers, surrendering career highs of eight runs and 12 hits in 4 1-3 innings of Sunday\'s 11-2 defeat.Both of Alvarez\'s starts against the Orioles this year have ended in losses for the Blue Jays despite his 3.21 ERA. That includes a visit to Baltimore on April 24, when he yielded two runs in seven innings of a 2-1 loss.Orioles right fielder Nick Markakis is 13 for 31 (.419) in his last eight games, but is 1 for 10 lifetime against Alvarez.

Bautista was sidelined for 5 1/2 weeks with inflammation in that same wrist.He was put back on the DL following the game.

After Mike McCoy was thrown out trying to steal, Bautista drew a two-out walk and Encarnacion hit a 2-2 pitch into the left-field seats - his third homer in five games and fifth over a 12-game span.Morrow struck out three of the first five batters he faced before the Orioles loaded the bases with two outs in the second for rookie Manny Machado, who struck out.Baltimore pulled even with two unearned runs in the third. Nick Markakis scored from second when shortstop Yunel Escobar let a potential double-play grounder skip past him, and Wieters followed with a sacrifice fly.After Jones singled in two runs in the fifth, Hardy hit a two-run drive off Chad Jenkins in the sixth and Wieters added an RBI single for a 7-2 lead.Machado drove in a seventh-inning run with a single.

He has a bit of mileage, and he\'s past the free-maintenance warranty, but he\'s a starting pitcher who hasn\'t completely crapped the bed this year and the Orioles are a team who needs a starting pitcher who won\'t do that heading down the stretch. OK, but you better really like Saunders, because the O\'s have traded Matt Lindstrom to get him. This comes as a surprise to me and it is probably a surprise to you as well. Saunders was a name linked to the O\'s for a while, and assorted joking, ""I wonder what six weeks of Joe Saunders costs?"" comments have been met with the names of various utility infielders. My most recent guess was Blake Davis. Instead, it\'s Lindstrom, who came over to the O\'s in the Guthrie trade and has been a nice part of the bullpen for the season, with a 2.72 ERA in the 36.1 innings he\'s pitched. The bullpen is a place where the Orioles have some surplus. With Jim Johnson, Pedro Strop and even Darren O\'Day turning in great seasons, the back end is pretty well locked down. Trade the seemingly least-needed piece of the \'pen for something you do need - a starter - and that\'s probably about what you want to do. Is Saunders worth the price? Now that is the more interesting question. In an 8-year big league career he has thrown over a thousand innings, including 200+ innings in each of the last two years. His career ERA is 4.17 and out in the desert in Arizona this year he pitched to a 4.22 ERA. His numbers aren\'t going to blow anyone\'s socks off, but that\'s not what the Orioles need - they need an improvement over Tommy Hunter, and that\'s what they should get. Saunders is more of a contact guy than a strikeout guy, and he\'s allowed 17 home runs so far this year, a HR/9 rate of 1.18 that\'s in line with his career 1.14.    None of which means that Saunders will do great in his next start. He could get lit up. There is something inherently bizarre and risky about stacking a starting rotation for Camden Yards that is full of fly ball pitchers. On the other hand, Dan Duquette seems to believe in the philosophy espoused by the 1996 Kelsey Grammar classic, Down Periscope: ""I think we prefer to go with the bizarre and risky. Worked for us so far."" Jake Arrieta is taking Lindstrom\'s roster spot for today and he will be available in the bullpen. Whether he will remain on the roster beyond the day is another question, but he can be easily optioned back to Norfolk. The O\'s are also receiving some ""cash considerations"" (amount not yet known) from the Diamondbacks and will be sending the Diamondbacks a PTBNL, probably after the season has concluded.

The Orioles (69-57) won their first two games against last-place Toronto this weekend before Sunday\'s finale was postponed because of weather.Chicago (71-55) figures to pose a far more difficult challenge as it enters this series after a 6-0 homestand to maintain a 2 1/2-game lead over Detroit in the Central. The White Sox completed a three-game sweep of Seattle with a 4-3 win Sunday after the game was called due to rain in the seventh.""Mother Nature is looking at us and giving us the blessing,"" reliever Hector Santiago told the White Sox\'s official website. ""Snake a win right there ... get out of here and go on the road trip.""Tyler Flowers hit a go-ahead, two-run homer in the seventh, Chicago\'s 32nd in the last 16 games. The White Sox lead the majors with 43 homers this month.After losing 11 of 14 at home, the Orioles have won 10 of 13 there. They\'ve averaged 5.5 runs and hit 22 homers during that stretch.Right fielder Nick Markakis had two hits and two runs in Saturday\'s 8-2 victory over the Blue Jays, and is hitting .419 (13 for 31) in his last eight games.Center fielder Adam Jones had two RBIs in that contest but hasn\'t homered in his last 104 at-bats, four shy of matching the longest drought of his career set in 2008. Jones, though, is 4 for 12 with three homers lifetime against scheduled White Sox starter Francisco Liriano.Looking to bolster an inconsistent rotation, Baltimore acquired starter Joe Saunders from Arizona on Sunday in exchange for reliever Matt Lindstrom and a player to be named later. Saunders is 6-10 with a 4.22 ERA this year.""I like our ballclub\'s chances,\'\' said Dan Duquette, the Orioles vice president of baseball operations. ""There\'s an old saying: If you\'re going in the right direction, keep walking. So the addition of Joe Saunders gives us a chance to keep walking in the right direction.""Baltimore sends it most consistent starter to the mound in the series opener in Wei-Yin Chen (12-7, 3.87 ERA). The left-hander won his second straight start despite allowing five runs and seven hits over five innings as the Orioles rallied for a 7-5 win at Detroit on Aug. 19.Chen limited the White Sox to two runs in 5 1-3 innings of a 3-2 victory on April 17.Also looking to win a third consecutive start will be Liriano (5-10, 5.12), who has pitched very well in four of his five starts since joining the White Sox. He gave up two runs and six hits over six innings of a 7-3 win over the Yankees on Tuesday.Liriano is 0-2 with a 6.30 ERA in two starts against Baltimore this season. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), (""Orioles 4, White Sox 3: Every game there's a different ..."", "" As I watched tonight's game I was mentally tallying all of their missed opportunities. When I wrote tonight's recap I wanted to have them fresh in my mind so that I could say that the Orioles lost this game due to A, B, and C. And they did miss a lot of chances to score against the White Sox struggling pitchers, and it did look like a good game by Wei-Yin Chen was going to go to waste. But then the Orioles did what the Orioles have done so many times this year, and they came back to win in an unexpected way. Came back to win by exactly one run, because that's what the Orioles do. Both starting pitchers tonight gave up just two runs, but it was not an evenly matched performance by any stretch of the imagination. White Sox starter Francisco Liriano was all over the place while Wei-Yin Chen was fantastic for six innings. After Chen retired the side in order in the first, Liriano gave up a single to leadoff man Nick Markakis. He retired the next two batters, but a two-out single from Matt Wieters put runners on the corners for Lew Ford. Yes, Lew Ford is still on the team. On the fourth pitch of Ford's at-bat, the ball got away from catcher A.J. Pierzynski and Markakis raced for home. The throw to Liriano covering got there just ahead of Nick and he was tagged out for the final out. Chen turned in another easy inning in the second, allowing the first of four hits on the night, a one-out single by Alex Rios. Rios was stranded at first, though, as Chen got the next two batters. Since Ford was at the plate when Markakis was thrown out to end the first inning, he got to start fresh as the first batter in the bottom of the second. He battled Liriano for a long at-bat and finally connected for a no doubt home run onto the flag court beyond right field. It was Ford's first homer in the majors since July 2007, and it gave the O's a 1-0 lead.    Remember those missed opportunities I mentioned? After Ford's home run, the Orioles loaded the bases with just one out, bringing Markakis to the plate. Markakis hit a liner to shortstop that Alexei Ramirez caught in the air. The ball wasn't smoked, but it was hit just hard enough, and Manny Machado at second base was just far enough away from the bag that he was doubled up easily to end the inning. So in an inning when the Orioles had four base runners thanks to two hits and two walks, the only run scored was on the leadoff homer. Liriano threw 24 pitches in the inning.    Chen continued to sail through the game, giving up one single each in the third and fourth innings, and retiring the side 1-2-3 in the fifth. Similiarly, Liriano didn't give up any runs in the same span, but he labored. Thanks mostly to an eight-pitch walk to Matt Wieters, he threw 22 pitches in the third inning, and it took him 22 more to retire the side in order in the fourth. Despite his obvious lack of control in the previous two innings, the Orioles were free swingers in the fifth, managing only a two-out single from J.J. Hardy in Liriano's eight-pitch inning. But in the sixth, that's when it hit the fan. Poor Chen, who needed to be perfect, wasn't. And the Orioles, again given a great opportunity, squandered it.    First, Chen. To that point he'd pitched five scoreless innings, giving up only three singles and no walks. The first batter of the inning, DeWayne Wise, hit a sharp grounder that Mark Reynolds made a good play on. He shuffled the ball to Chen, but he couldn't handle it and it dropped out of his glove. An error was called on him and the first runner was on. It was frustrating, but it was the first mistake Chen made all night. With the tying run on base thanks to the error, Chen had to face longtime Orioles nemesis Kevin Youkilis. Ugh. I think in the short time he's been gone from the Red Sox I had forgotten just how ugly that dude is. But ugly or not, he can still hit. And he went the opposite way on the first pitch he saw for a two-run homer. That homer hurt for so many reasons. The Orioles had chances to score, chances to knock Liriano out of the game, and they didn't take advantage. And now they were losing 2-1. Chen got his act together after that, although he did issue a one-out walk to Paul Konerko. But he struck out Rios and Pierzynksi to end the inning and his night. Just a great game by Chen. His final line; 6 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 8 K, 1 HR. Could the Orioles come back and score some runs in support of Chen's great effort? Well...sort of. Liriano started the sixth inning but after walking Wieters and giving up a single to Ford, he was pulled in favor of Jesse Crain. Like Liriano before him, Crain struggled mightily with his control. He walked Reynolds to load the bases, and then also walked McLouth. McLouth was gutsy in taking the final pitch, which looked very close to the top of the strike zone. But the ump called it a ball and he trotted to first base as Wieters came in with the tying run. It's a tie game and the Orioles had the bases loaded with no outs. Time to break this thing open, right? Wrong. Machado: grounded into a force out at home (that Pierzysnki didn't follow up with a throw to first for the double play. Weird). Robert Andino: strike out. Nick Markakis: slow ground ball to shortstop that he somehow didn't beat to first base. Just like that three outs, no more runs. Sigh. The White Sox went ahead in the eighth inning with Pedro Strop on the mound. Strop gave up two singles to put runners on the corners with no outs, which brought Konerko to the plate. He hit a ground ball to first base, fielded by Reynolds, who tried to throw to first for the out....but no one was covering the base! Strop, where were you?? A run came in to score on the play, although in fairness a run would have come in even if they'd gotten the out. Strop bounced back from his troubles with a double play ball and a strikeout, but the damage had been done. The Orioles were down 3-2 and they'd been failing at the plate the entire game. Missed opportunities. It felt like a lost game. But that's when the Orioles Magic kicked into gear. Brett Myers, pitching his second inning in relief, walked Reynolds with one out, putting the tying run on. Nate McLouth, who had walked with the bases loaded to bring home the Orioles last run, had something a little more dramatic in mind for this one. He took Myers deep to right field for his second home run as an Oriole. O's take the lead, 4-3! McLouth, who hadn't been good since 2009, who was cut by Pirates earlier this year, who spent a decent chunk of time in Norfolk, has found himself in the thick of things since his promotion to Baltimore. I don't know how he's doing it, I don't know what is happening. All I know is that the Orioles tonight got home runs from Nate McLouth and Lew Ford. Armed with the lead, Jim Johnson came in trying to earn his 40th save. He gave us a little drama with a two-out single, a wild pitch to put the tying run at second, and an eight-pitch at-bat to Gordon Beckham, but as usual, he prevailed. I don't know how much more my heart can take regarding this team. What I do know is that while the Orioles won tonight, the Yankees and Rays both lost. That means the Orioles are now in sole possession of 2nd place in the AL East, just 3.5 games behind the Yankees. And they are tied with the Oakland A's, who also won tonight, for the first wild card spot. Oh boy.  "", 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

They took a 3-2 lead in the top of the eighth inning before Nate McLouth\'s two-run homer in the bottom half gave the Orioles a 4-3 victory.Baltimore overcame a pair of one-run deficits in its franchise-record 13th consecutive one-run win.""This is as good of a club as I\'ve ever had about staying in the moment,\'\' manager Buck Showalter said.

I think that\'s probably fair to say. But I love playing baseball. The Orioles were gracious to give me an opportunity and I\'m happy to be here. I\'m excited. It\'s been fun so far.\'\'With its third straight win and 15th in 21 games, Baltimore (70-57) moved into a tie with Oakland for the top wild-card spot and pulled within 3 1/2 games of the East-leading Yankees.A win Tuesday would put the Orioles 14 games over .500 for the first time since they were 42-28 on June 21, 2005.Chicago, meanwhile, had its lead in the Central trimmed to two games over idle Detroit with its fourth straight road loss. Kevin Youkilis hit a two-run homer and is batting .333 with six home runs and 18 RBIs in his last 13 games at Camden Yards.Sale (15-4, 2.65 ERA) was outstanding again in his most recent appearance, allowing only Derek Jeter\'s solo homer and two other hits while striking out 13 in 7 2-3 innings of a 2-1 victory over the Yankees on Wednesday.The left-hander - among the major league wins leaders - agreed that his performance was perhaps the best of his young career.""If it\'s not, it\'s up there for sure,\'\' Sale said.

The Orioles won 4-3. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Nate McLouth and Lew Ford added their names to the Baltimore Orioles' rapidly expanding list of unlikely heroes.McLouth put Baltimore ahead with a two-run homer in the eighth inning, Ford also connected, and the Orioles beat the White Sox 4-3 on Monday night, ending Chicago's six-game winning streak.It was the franchise-record 13th consecutive one-run win for the Orioles, who trailed 2-1 in the sixth and 3-2 in the eighth. Baltimore is 24-6 in one-run games and 45-18 in games decided by one or two runs.''This is as good of a club as I've ever had about staying in the moment,'' said manager Buck Showalter, now 173-173 since being hired on Aug. 3, 2010. ''That's a challenge when you are around so many things that aren't really realistic, to stay together and challenge the things that really are important.''It's hard to fathom what the Orioles (70-57) have accomplished this year following 14 straight losing seasons. It's also difficult to imagine players like McLouth and Ford making major contributions in an important win. They were teammates with Triple-A Norfolk a month ago, and now they're providing Baltimore with a playoff push.''That's why they got us up here,'' said Ford, whose second-inning homer was his first in the majors since July 29, 2007, with Minnesota against Cleveland. After that season, Ford didn't return to the big leagues until being summoned by the Orioles in late July.After the White Sox went up 3-2 in the eighth against Pedro Strop (5-2) on a run-scoring infield single by Adam Dunn, Baltimore answered in the bottom half against Brett Myers (2-2).Mark Reynolds drew a one-out walk and McLouth drove a 1-0 pitch far over the wall in right-center. It was his third RBI of the game and second home run since the Orioles purchased his contract from Norfolk on Aug. 4.''I sure didn't want it to go straight over the plate, which is where it went,'' Myers said of the ill-fated fastball. ''I wish I could have that one pitch back, but you know that isn't going to happen.''Asked if he ever doubted something like this could happen after being released by Pittsburgh at the end of May, McLouth replied, ''Maybe. I think that's probably fair to say. But I love playing baseball. The Orioles were gracious to give me an opportunity and I'm happy to be here. I'm excited. It's been fun so far.''Jim Johnson pitched the ninth for his 40th save in 43 opportunities.Facing the Orioles for the first time with Chicago after tormenting them as a member of the Boston Red Sox, Kevin Youkilis hit a two-run homer in the sixth inning and singled in the eighth to set up Dunn's RBI hit. Youkilis has a lifetime .322 batting average against Baltimore, with 23 homers and 87 RBIs.''You never want to lose a game like that,'' Youkilis said. ''We had the lead and Nate hit that home run.''The duel between the first-place White Sox and the surprising Orioles - who moved within 3 1/2 games of first-place New York in the AL East and stayed in the midst of the wild-card race - attracted a meager crowd of 10,955 on a clear night at Camden Yards.Orioles starter Wei-Yin Chen gave up two runs, one earned, and four hits in six innings. He struck out eight, including A.J. Pierzynski three times.Down 1-0, Chicago took the lead in the sixth. After Chen dropped a throw to first base for an error, Youkilis homered on the next pitch.Baltimore pulled even in the bottom half. A walk to Matt Wieters and a single by Ford put runners at the corners with no outs and prompted White Sox manager Robin Ventura to replace starter Francisco Liriano with Jesse Crain, who walked Reynolds and McLouth to force in a run. Crain then got Manny Machado to hit into a force at the plate, struck out Robert Andino and retired Nick Markakis on a slow roller to shortstop.It was another missed opportunity for the Orioles, who had several in the early going.In the first inning, Markakis was tagged out by Liriano while trying to score from third on a pitch that bounced away from Pierzynski and rolled to the right of the plate.After Ford hit an opposite-field drive to right leading off the second, the Orioles loaded the bases with one out before Markakis lined into a double play.NOTES: White Sox RHP Gavin Floyd had a MRI on his right elbow Monday in Chicago. Ventura said no damage was found, but Floyd was scratched from Friday's start against Detroit in favor of Jake Peavy, who was slated to pitch Wednesday. Dylan Axelrod will pitch Wednesday. ... The Orioles optioned Jake Arrieta to Norfolk to make room for LHP Joe Saunders, obtained Sunday in a trade with Arizona. Saunders will make his first start either Wednesday or Thursday, Showalter said. ... RHP Jason Hammel (knee) threw a simulated three-inning game at Camden Yards. He will next make a rehabilitation start on Sept. 1 and could rejoin the team on Sept. 6, Showalter said. ... Baltimore's Adam Jones went 0 for 4 and is homerless in 108 at-bats, tying the longest drought of his career. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Baltimore Orioles: ""In Buck we trust"" - Birds Watcher', 'When the Baltimore Orioles hired Buck Showalter in August of 2010 most Orioles fans were happy that the team had a bona fide big league manager. While Showalter certainly wasn\xe2\x80\x99t Casey Stengel, he did have a lot of major league managing experience, and the presumption was that he\xe2\x80\x99d bring a degree of professionalism to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse. However in putting myself back into the mindset of that time, I seem to remember a lot of people also assuming that at some point Showalter would end up with the same blank look on his face in the dugout as his predecessors. In other words Showalter was a good hire, but odds are it blows up in everyone\xe2\x80\x99s face simply because it\xe2\x80\x99s the Orioles.Image Courtesy of USA TodayOver two years later, I have to wonder if that mindset still exists among any Orioles fans. I don\xe2\x80\x99t think that Showalter knows the game any better or worse than anyone that came before him, however he has brought a degree of accountability to the team that perhaps wasn\xe2\x80\x99t previously there in the past. He\xe2\x80\x99s also made the players believe in themselves, and shown them that they had the tools to grab the bull by the horns and win games at the big league level. Looking at last night\xe2\x80\x99s game, would the Orioles have won that three or four years ago? (Please don\xe2\x80\x99t misread me; this is not meant to be a conviction of the men that came before Showalter\xe2\x80\xa6)The Orioles got six solid innings from Wei-Yin Chen, who made one bad pitch. With the Orioles leading 1-0 on the feels of Lew Ford\xe2\x80\x99s first big league home run in five years, Chen hung a change up to Kevin Youkilis. Keep in mind that throughout his career with the Boston Red Sox Youkilis has been an Oriole-killer, so it wasn\xe2\x80\x99t overly surprising that he rose the occasion. Again, think back three or four years; not only would the Orioles have just accepted defeat, but they probably would have allowed three or four more ChiSox runs to cross. However in the last of the sixth the Orioles loaded the bases with Nate McClouth coming to the plate. Perhaps in an act of foreshadowing, McClouth had a solid at-bat and drew a walk. That was the only run the O\xe2\x80\x99s could push across that inning, however it knotted the game at two.Kevin Youkilis wasn\xe2\x80\x99t done with the Orioles at that point, as he moved a runner to third base with a single to right field. That run scored to give Chicago a 3-2 lead on Adam Dunn\xe2\x80\x99s infield single in the eighth. However in the last of the inning the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 walk leader (Mark Reynolds) got a free pass to first base, bringing Nate McClouth to the plate. McClouth hit a ball that might just be landing now somewhere near Philadelphia, to put the Birds ahead to stay. Jim Johnson closed Chicago out in the ninth giving the Orioles a 4-3 win in the first game of the series.In 2011 the Birds reached 69 wins on September 28th when they beat Boston to knock them out of the playoffs. That only came as a result of a feverish September where they in effect played at a playoff level. With last night\xe2\x80\x99s win, the Orioles officially bettered that mark with their 70th victory\xe2\x80\xa6on August 27th. While the makeup of the team is better year-over-year, you can mostly chalk that up to good managing. And I\xe2\x80\x99m not talking X\xe2\x80\x99s and O\xe2\x80\x99s, but more so the mindset that Buck Showalter has brought to the franchise. Call it whatever you wish\xe2\x80\xa6never say die, play \xe2\x80\x99till the last out, etc. However he\xe2\x80\x99s the maestro of one heck of an orchestra, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t see fit to stop playing anytime soon. The series continues tonight as Chris Tillman takes back to the hill tonight after a six-day hiatus (due to a rainout) against Chicago\xe2\x80\x99s Chris Sale. With last night\xe2\x80\x99s win (combined with NY and Tampa\xe2\x80\x99s losses), the Orioles are now in a tie with Oakland for the first wild card slot, and they\xe2\x80\x99ve moved back into second place in the AL East, 3.5 games behind the NY Yankees.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- It's hard to determine which was more impressive: Chris Tillman's domination of the White Sox, or the how the Baltimore Orioles mistreated Chicago ace Chris Sale.Tillman allowed one hit over seven innings, Nick Markakis drove in three runs and Baltimore cruised to a 6-0 victory Tuesday night to extend its winning streak to four.Lew Ford homered for the second time in two nights and Adam Jones hit his 100th career home run for the Orioles, who moved a season-high 14 games over .500 (71-57) and remained atop the AL wild-card standings.The only hit against Tillman (7-2) was a dribbler by Dayan Viciedo in the fifth inning that shortstop J.J. Hardy couldn't snag with an attempted barehanded pickup.''If J.J. isn't making the play, then no one's making the play,'' said Tillman, who lamented his four walks more than that one scratch hit.''There were plenty of games where I had better stuff,'' the right-hander insisted. ''There were some spurts there when I kind of got out of whack.''Brian Matusz worked the final two innings, allowing one hit in completing Baltimore's seventh shutout.Sale (15-5) gave up four runs and six hits in four innings, his shortest start of the season. Coming off a 13-strikeout win over the Yankees, the left-hander lost for the second time in six starts since July 21.Asked why he was removed after only 75 pitches, Sale replied, ''Just came to me after the fourth and said that's it for the night. You don't want to get that call. I didn't do anything to help our team win tonight. I kind of put them in a tough spot, pulling the starter after four. I got no one to blame but myself. That's as bad as it gets.''Chicago manager Robin Ventura said, ''It was just one of those evenings it didn't look like he had it.''It was the fifth straight road loss for the White Sox, who won six in a row at home before dropping the first two of this four-game series. It was Chicago's most lopsided shutout defeat of the season.The Orioles have won 12 of 15 at home as they continue toward their first winning season in 15 years, but their scintillating play has not attracted large crowds at Camden Yards this week. Only 12,814 showed up for this one, slightly more than the 10,955 on Monday night.Those in attendance saw an impressive pitching performance by Tillman, who has as many wins this year as in his previous three seasons combined.''Tillman shut down one of the game's best offenses,'' Jones said. ''Those guys are hitting . He shut that lineup down.''After Sale struck out the first two batters in the second inning, Baltimore used a single by Nate McLouth and two walks to load the bases for Markakis, who drove in three runs with a double to center.''It was almost like I hit a brick wall,'' Sale said. ''The first couple of (batters) I felt like I was dialed in, throwing strikes. Then it just got away.''Ford made it 4-0 in the third with a drive to left, making it seven straight games in which Sale has given up at least one home run. The last time Ford homered on successive nights was in 2005, when he homered in three consecutive games with Minnesota.Manny Machado delivered a sacrifice fly in the sixth and Jones hit an opposite-field shot to right in the seventh. The drive ended a career-high 110 at-bat homerless drought and gave him 25 for the season, tying a career high.Earlier this week, the slumping Jones said he was on ''a vacation.'' Asked if was back, he replied, ''I booked the flight back home. I'm on standby or something. I don't know. But that's why you've got 25 guys here to pick you up.''NOTES: McLouth had a season-high three hits. ... LHP Joe Saunders will make his Orioles debut on Wednesday night, starting against Chicago RHP Dylan Axelrod, who was recalled by the White Sox from Triple-A Charlotte on Tuesday. Axelrod replaces Gavin Floyd, who was placed on the 15-day DL with an elbow injury. ... The last time Baltimore was 14 games over .500 was June 21, 2005 (42-28). ... Chicago C A.J. Pierzynski went 0 for 3 and is hitless in his last 14 at-bats. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

""They\'re going to try to compete with the team we\'re trying to catch.""The mood is different for New York (75-55), which led the division by 10 games over the Orioles on July 18. The Yankees are 18-21 since.""It\'s baseball. You look forward to the series (against Baltimore),"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""You got a chance to put more space between you and them.""The Orioles are 24-6 in one-run games, winning 13 straight such contests to set a franchise record. They have taken five of the last seven meetings with the Yankees after losing the first four 2012 matchups.""Trust me, this group is going to have fun with it,"" said Showalter about the pennant race.The Yankees are losers of six of nine after dropping two of three this week at home to last-place Toronto. Their next 10 games are against the teams right behind them in the division, with a road trip beginning next Monday against third-place Tampa Bay followed by a visit to Camden Yards.New York is worried first about this series.""We\'ve got to bring it against the Orioles this weekend, for sure,"" catcher Russell Martin said. ""It\'s a big one.""The Yankees will give the ball to their best 2012 starter, Hiroki Kuroda (12-9, 2.98 ERA). The right-hander is 4-2 with a 1.66 ERA over his last eight outings, posting his third complete game Saturday in a 3-1 defeat at Cleveland.Kuroda has been particularly dominant at home lately, going 3-1 with a 0.94 ERA in his past five starts at Yankee Stadium.He won his lone career matchup with the Orioles on April 30, yielding one run in seven innings of a 2-1 home victory.New York will be without injured sluggers Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira for this series, with Steve Pearce getting a pair of starts this week. Pearce, traded from New York to Baltimore on June 2 and re-acquired by the Yankees from Houston on Monday, will likely face the Orioles for the first time.Derek Jeter, who leads the majors with 176 hits, is batting .438 in the season series while Curtis Granderson has homered five times.Nick Swisher has batted .167 in his last 11 games against Baltimore, but the outfielder is hitting .349 with 21 RBIs over his last 22 games.The Yankees will get their second look at rookie right-hander Miguel Gonzalez (5-3, 3.66), who won at New York on July 30 by allowing four runs over 6 2-3 innings in a 5-4 victory. The Orioles have won six of his nine starts.Gonzalez hasn\'t taken the mound since Aug. 20, when he gave up four runs and eight hits in five innings of a 5-1 loss at Texas.Matt Wieters will be back behind the plate after Showalter gave him Thursday off. Wieters is mired in an 8-for-51 slump, but he\'s hit safely in all 11 of his games against New York this season while batting .429.Yankees pitchers have yet to face Nate McLouth this year. McLouth has been the latest unsung hero for the Orioles, scoring 10 runs and driving in seven over his last 10 games.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Zach Britton made an ample contribution to the Baltimore Orioles' pennant drive, striking out a career-high 10 over eight innings in a win over the Chicago White Sox.Then, as his teammates prepared to take a train to New York for a huge series against the Yankees, Britton packed his bags for a drive to Norfolk, home of Baltimore's Triple-A affiliate.He won't be gone for long.Britton's stellar pitching performance, along with home runs by Taylor Teagarden and Adam Jones, carried the Orioles to a 5-3 victory Thursday.Baltimore took three of four from the AL Central-leading White Sox to complete a 5-1 homestand that started with a two-game sweep of Toronto. The Orioles now stand within three games of the idle AL East-leading Yankees, who will be trying to retain that margin in the three-game series that begins Friday night.''Trust me, this group is going to have fun with it,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.The Orioles head north with a suitcase full of momentum.''It's nice to take this one to New York,'' said Britton, who was optioned to Norfolk after the game to make room for left-hander Randy Wolf, signed Thursday after being cut by Milwaukee last week.Britton (4-1) gave up one run, seven hits and did not issue a walk. He fanned Dewayne Wise three times and eclipsed his previous single-game career high of seven strikeouts by the fifth inning.''I think Zach will be back,'' Showalter said, adding, ''Zach was hiding from me tonight.''The Orioles can't wait for his return.''If he can go out and give you eight innings with no walks, he's going to be hard to beat,'' Jones said. ''That was the most impressive I've seen him.''Britton allowed hits to five of the first nine batters he faced, but finished by retiring 19 of 21.After Pedro Strop surrendered two singles in the ninth, Jim Johnson got an out, then gave up a two-run single to Alexei Ramirez before striking out Gordon Beckham for his 41st save.The game drew a crowd of 10,141, smallest of the season at Camden Yards. There should be substantially more fans in the stands at Yankee Stadium.''Our guys aren't going up there to experience the atmosphere,'' Showalter said. ''They're going to try to compete with the team we're trying to catch.''Ramirez went 7 for 13 with five RBIs in the series, but the White Sox finished 2-6 against Baltimore this season. Chicago next travels to Detroit for a showdown between the top two teams in the AL Central.''You've got to go in there and put this series behind us and hopefully go into Detroit and play well,'' catcher A.J. Pierzynski said. ''The Orioles are playing well right now. They have a confidence about them, especially at home. We're out of here now and we have to worry about Detroit.''Rookie Jose Quintana (5-3) allowed five runs and seven hits in 3 2-3 innings, matching the shortest outing of his career. He entered with an 0.88 ERA in day games and was 3-0 with a 3.34 ERA in nine road starts.His downfall came in the second, when he gave up five straight extra-base hits.''They got to him in that inning,'' manager Robin Ventura said. ''Everything was kind of up and kind of the same speed, really. They can hit, and they got him.''Teagarden, the backup catcher behind Matt Wieters, came in batting .086 (3 for 35). In addition to his third-inning home run, he also doubled in a run in the fourth.Chicago wasted a double by newcomer Jose Lopez in the first inning, then scored only one run on four hits in the second. After Pierzynski was thrown out at the plate by Jones trying to score from second on a single to center by Ramirez, Beckham hit a two-out RBI single before Wise struck out with runners on the corners.Quintana opened by getting eight straight outs before Teagarden hit an opposite-field drive to right, the first of five straight two-out extra-base hits by the Orioles. Nick Markakis and J.J. Hardy followed with doubles and Jones hit his career-high 26th home run before Mark Reynolds capped the surge with a double.Baltimore made it 5-1 in the fourth when Nate McLouth singled and Teagarden doubled to center.NOTES: The White Sox purchased the contract of Lopez from Triple-A Charlotte, placed C Tyler Flowers on the paternity list, purchased the contract of C Hector Gimenez from Charlotte, moved RHP Brian Bruney (hip) to the 60-day DL and released RHP Gregory Infante. ... Four of Teagarden's five hits this season are for extra bases - two homers and two doubles. ... Orioles DH Nick Johnson, who went on the DL in late June with a wrist injury, is likely done for the season, Showalter said. ... Chicago outhit Baltimore 10-8.

He was fully prepared to report to Class AAA Norfolk with the expectation that he would soon be recalled to join the Orioles in a pennant race.The concept remained true, but the details differed. Pearce, now a reserve outfielder for the Yankees, singled in the seventh to a start a three-run rally that lifted his new team to a 4-3 win over the Orioles on Saturday as the race to the top of the American League East continued to be intriguing.The victory pushed the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 division lead back to three games, but their position feels only minimally more secure. The Yankees have one more game against Baltimore to wrap up this homestand and four more this week at Baltimore, and the Orioles have proved they have the means to stick around.

Hardy - the sixth of the year for the sure-handed shortstop - helped the Yankees (76-56) to a three-run rally and a 4-3 win to restore their division lead to three games.""We\'re just going to come back,"" said Baltimore reliever Pedro Strop, who walked in the tying run. ""We\'ve got another 1 o\'clock game tomorrow, and we don\'t have time to be thinking about it.""The defeat ended a streak of 13 straight victories in one-run games for Baltimore, which is still 24-7 in such contests, a huge reason the club is in position for its first playoff berth in 15 years.""It\'s not one of those things that we\'re going to dwell on. This could have been. That should have been. That would have been,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We understand that. These guys will turn the page.""The Orioles are trying to turn the page on their dismal recent history. They\'ve finished last each of the past four years in a division the Yankees have won 11 times since Baltimore last captured it in 1997.Derek Jeter has been a part of all of those New York teams, and the Yankees\' experience may be an asset down the stretch.""If you win, they say experience helps,"" Jeter said. ""If you lose, they say you don\'t have enough youth.""You don\'t look at the standings,"" he added. ""If we play well, we\'ll be fine.""The Orioles, whose lead for the second AL wild card is at 1 1/2 games over Tampa Bay, turn to Chris Tillman (7-2, 3.26 ERA) as they try to take two of three in the Bronx for the third time this year.

""Those guys are hitting. He shut that lineup down.""The Yankees certainly have one of baseball\'s best lineups, but they may not have Curtis Granderson in Sunday\'s version after he left Saturday\'s game with tightness in his right hamstring.Phil Hughes (13-11, 4.02) will be on the mound looking to win a seventh consecutive decision at Yankee Stadium, where he\'s 10-3 with a 3.25 ERA this year.The right-hander has won four straight home starts and is 6-0 in the last seven with a 1.62 ERA.

Hardy added a solo shot for the Orioles, who moved within two games of the first-place Yankees by winning the opener of their big three-game series. That\'s the closest Baltimore has been since a 1\xc2\xbd-game deficit on June 22, less than a month before the Yankees opened a season-high 10-game cushion on July 18.""Keep doubting, we don\'t care,"" Reynolds said. ""We\'re coming in, doing our jobs and doing the little things to win baseball games.""Buck Showalter\'s young team has been gaining ground all month, winning 18 of its last 25 to head into September as serious playoff contenders for the first time in 15 years.The latest victory increased Baltimore\'s lead over Tampa Bay to 2\xc2\xbd games for the second AL wild-card spot. Sitting at his locker, however, reliever Luis Ayala wore an orange T-shirt that summed up the Orioles\' primary goal: ""Buck the Yankees.""""You can tell, especially in this clubhouse, the quiet confidence that everyone has, expecting to win every night,"" Reynolds said. ""So we\'re just going to keep riding this wave as long as it lasts.""Reynolds made two spectacular plays at first base and Chris Davis had a sacrifice fly in Baltimore\'s three-run second against Hiroki Kuroda (12-10), the Yankees\' most consistent and durable starter this season. The 37-year-old right-hander gave up eight hits in 8 1-3 innings, going at least eight for the fourth straight outing, but again was hurt by a lack of run support.Pitching on 10 days\' rest, Gonzalez (6-3) yielded only four harmless singles to win for the fourth time in five decisions. He walked one and threw 66 of 97 pitches for strikes in his second win at Yankee Stadium. The right-hander beat New York 5-4 on July 30, setting his previous career best with eight strikeouts in 6 2-3 innings.""I think the adrenaline gets me going, helps me out,"" Gonzalez said. ""I just like pitching against a good offensive team, I guess.""Featuring a fine changeup and spotting his sneaky 91-93 mph fastball effectively, Gonzalez pitched like a poised veteran in his 10th major league start as the Orioles improved to 5-2 at Yankee Stadium this year. He didn\'t have a three-ball count until the sixth inning.""He was real fresh tonight. Obviously, he responded,"" Orioles pitching coach Rick Adair said. ""I think Gonzo\'s a guy that really stays in the moment. He knows where he\'s been. ... He\'s a very fierce competitor. So we\'re glad to have him.""Swisher whiffed all four times up for the skidding Yankees, who have dropped seven of 10 and nine of 14. This was the first of 10 consecutive games against Baltimore and Tampa Bay, their two closest pursuers in the AL East.The 28-year-old Gonzalez, born in Mexico, sat out the 2008 and 2009 seasons because of a knee injury and Tommy John surgery. He was 0-7 with a 5.40 ERA at three spots in Boston\'s farm system last season, then was released by the Red Sox in December. He signed with Baltimore during spring training and began the season at Triple-A Norfolk.""I think he\'s a guy that\'s just letting it fly and trusting himself,"" Showalter said. ""He doesn\'t have anything to lose. Heck, he\'s had a lot of people in his career tell him that he couldn\'t do something and I think he knows he\'s in a place where people get him and know what he brings.""The absence of injured sluggers Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira is catching up with the Yankees. Dominated by Gonzalez, they have three hits in 21 at-bats with runners in scoring position over the past two games.""It just seemed like his fastball was getting on the hitters quicker than they thought,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said.Darren O\'Day worked the eighth and Brian Matusz gave up Curtis Granderson\'s 34th home run in the ninth before finishing the five-hitter. But the story was Gonzalez.""He was just filling up the strike zone,"" Swisher said. ""He\'s kind of a shorter guy, kind of throws it right out of his ear. You\'ve just got to give him credit, man. He shut us down tonight.""Adam Jones and Matt Wieters opened the second inning with consecutive singles before Davis\' sacrifice fly put the Orioles in front. Reynolds followed with a two-run drive into the second deck in left.Reynolds connected again off Derek Lowe with two outs in the ninth. Nick Markakis added an RBI single to make it 6-0.Hardy hit his 18th homer off Kuroda in the sixth. Baltimore has won 18 games in a month for the first time since September 2004.NOTES: Baltimore announced the signing of 36-year-old LHP Randy Wolf, cut by Milwaukee last week. Both lefties in the team\'s bullpen are converted starters: Wolf and Matusz. ... It was Reynolds\' 16th career multihomer game and second this season. ...

His eyelids fluttered. Gripping the microphone, Girardi then checked himself and rehashed what his thought process was before Reynolds\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer changed the direction of Sunday\xe2\x80\x99s game like a sudden burst of wind reversing a weather vane.For Girardi, it was a rare (albeit momentary) break from his usual stone-still character and his practiced and patient responses about his level of concern: panic, what panic?Yet a 10-game lead in the American League East has been whittled to two after the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 8-3 loss to the Baltimore Orioles, baring the fissures in a once-dominating season.

The original question was left in the dust \xe2\x80\x94 exactly the way Showalter wanted it.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles, though, are no longer a team to be ignored or even conditionally praised for being just a feel-good story. There was natural skepticism about how a young Baltimore club would handle playing in the Bronx in a pennant race. It responded by flattening the Yankees on Sunday to take the weekend series, 2-1, and improve to 19-8 since Aug. 4.

They play like a team. It\xe2\x80\x99s been fun to watch.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees switched up their starting rotation after Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s day off to ensure Hughes had a start at home, where he had been 10-3 this season.

Privacy Policy    A strong start in an important rubber match, however, dissolved unexpectedly. Hughes pitched crisply through the first five innings, holding Baltimore to a leadoff homer to Mark Reynolds in the fifth that reduce a Yankees lead to 2-1.But Hughes started the sixth by walking Nate McLouth, and Adam Jones followed with a single on the first pitch he saw. Next, Matt Wieters singled after two pitches, driving in McLouth. Then the dangerous Reynolds drove an 0-1 curveball deep into the stands in left.

But planning that far ahead ended up costing him.\xe2\x80\x9cI thought that was Hughes\xe2\x80\x99s guy to get out,\xe2\x80\x9d Girardi said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd he didn\xe2\x80\x99t do it.\xe2\x80\x9dThe scoring in the sixth erased the lead the Yankees had worked hard to attain, with their depleted lineup down another central figure, Curtis Granderson, who left Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game with a tight right hamstring. Granderson is not expected to miss much time, and Girardi said he thought Alex Rodriguez could rejoin the team against Tampa Bay by Monday.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On Sunday, however, the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 lone highlights were provided by Granderson\xe2\x80\x99s replacement, the fresh call-up Chris Dickerson. In his first major league at-bat of the season, Dickerson laced a two-run shot to right. He also walked and scored a run in the fifth and robbed Adam Jones of a potential home run with a leaping catch at the wall in the seventh.But the Yankees failed to capitalize on the defensive gem, and Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s bullpen closed the game without a hiccup.

No Baltimore team had had more than five wins on the road against the Yankees since 1997, the last time the Orioles beat out the Yankees for the division title.The Orioles are closing in again.\xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, we\xe2\x80\x99re finding that we\xe2\x80\x99re becoming a little bit better,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cThey\xe2\x80\x99ve been the measuring stick for a long time.\xe2\x80\x9dINSIDE PITCHAndy Pettitte threw 35 pitches in a bullpen session Sunday and said the next step in his recovery from a broken left ankle could be throwing batting practice in the near future. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99ll report back in with doc and the trainers and see what the next step is,\xe2\x80\x9d Pettitte said. \xe2\x80\x9cToday was a good day.\xe2\x80\x9d ... Orioles starter Chris Tillman left after the third inning because of stiffness in his elbow. Randy Wolf, who was released Aug. 22 by Milwaukee, pitched three and a third innings in relief of Tillman to earn the win. It was Wolf\xe2\x80\x99s first appearance with Baltimore.

They left trailing the Yankees by only two games in the American League East race.Reynolds drove in 7 of those 17 runs, hitting four home runs to help the young, happy-go-lucky Orioles continue their hunt for a playoff spot, seemingly defying mathematics along the way.\xe2\x80\x9cYou look at a lot of the young guys in here, they don\xe2\x80\x99t even know they\xe2\x80\x99re in the middle of a playoff race, probably,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cEveryone in here is having fun and going out and playing hard.\xe2\x80\x9dHe added, \xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99re right where we want to be.\xe2\x80\x9dReynolds, 29, has been in this type of situation before. The last team to make the playoffs despite a negative run differential was the 2007 Arizona Diamondbacks. Reynolds played 111 games for the Diamondbacks that season and hit 17 home runs. The current Orioles team has the capacity for power, he said, but shows it only in flashes.

We had the same deal.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Reynolds, who hit two home runs during the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 6-1 win Friday night, belted his first on Sunday with his team trailing by 2-0 in the fifth. Leading off the inning, he blasted a high fastball from Phil Hughes several rows into the left-field stands, slicing the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 deficit in half.The next inning, as he strolled to the plate with two runners on, the Yankees, who led then, 3-2, might have been expected to take certain precautions. But they did not. There was no pitching change, no conference on the mound, and Reynolds delivered again, crushing a hanging curveball from Hughes into the left-field seats for a go-ahead three-run homer.\xe2\x80\x9cI was looking for something I could elevate, try to get a sac fly, bring that run in,\xe2\x80\x9d Reynolds said. \xe2\x80\x9cHe hung a curveball. I was just trying to hit a fly ball and just got lucky enough to carry it out of the park.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The performance continued a hot run for Reynolds, who was hitting .208 with eight home runs from April through July. In 23 games since Aug. 6, he has five doubles, eight home runs and a .320 average. Reynolds acknowledged that the weekend would provide another mental boost, but insisted that it was not something to dwell upon.

(AP Photo/Kathy Kmonicek)MoreNEW YORK (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles quickly fell behind, had their starting pitcher go out with an injury after three innings and looked lost against Phil Hughes. The finale of the first key September series for the Orioles in 15 years was not going well.Didn\'t matter one bit to Mark Reynolds and his teammates.Reynolds hit a three-run shot in the sixth inning for his second two-homer game of the weekend series and the Orioles closed in on the AL East-leading New York Yankees with an 8-3 victory Sunday.""You look at a lot of young guys in here \xe2\x80\x94 they don\'t even know they\'re in the middle of a playoff race probably,"" Reynolds said. ""Everyone in here\'s having fun, going out and playing hard.""Randy Wolf (1-0) made his first appearance for Baltimore when starter Chris Tillman left with right elbow stiffness after the third inning. He helped the Orioles, who haven\'t been to the playoffs since 1997, pull within two games of the Yankees with 3 1-3 effective innings.Tillman will have an MRI in Baltimore on Monday but didn\'t think the injury was serious. In fact, he thought he could still pitch when he was lifted Sunday. He didn\'t think that would be fair to the club, though, with so much at stake.""I was kind of coming down on myself hard there for coming out of the game,"" Tillman said. ""But Randy picked me up huge \xe2\x80\x94 and what a series Mark had. It was fun to watch.""Reynolds made the ballpark in the Bronx his personal launching pad in this unlikely showdown between the top two teams in the division. He homered twice in Friday\'s victory then got Baltimore on the scoreboard Sunday when he hit a mammoth drive leading off the fifth inning. Reynolds connected shortly after being sent to the dirt by Hughes\' high-and-tight offering.Reynolds\' 16th homer with none out in the sixth finished Hughes (13-12) and put Baltimore ahead 5-3.""I thought that was Hughes\' guy to get out,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""He didn\'t do it.""Playing under ominous gray skies, the Yankees fell to 19-23 since opening a 10-game division lead on July 18. By the time the stadium lights went on in the eighth, Baltimore was well on its way to its 19th win in 27 games.Matt Wieters had an RBI single in helping Baltimore win its third series of the year in New York for the first time since 1976.""Hopefully it\'s a sign we\'re becoming a little better because they\'ve been the measuring stick for a long time,"" Showalter said.September call-up Chris Dickerson gave New York a 2-0 lead in the second inning with a homer in his first at-bat of the season. But Girardi\'s plan in which he juggled his rotation to give Hughes a start at Yankee Stadium \xe2\x80\x94 where he has excelled this season \xe2\x80\x94 backfired.Now the Yankees embark on a 10-game road trip against division rivals Tampa Bay, Baltimore and Boston with their first place standing in jeopardy.""They pitch, they hit. The bottom line is they beat us and we\'ll see them again in a few days,"" Derek Jeter said of the Orioles.With Curtis Granderson joining Alex Rodriguez and Mark Teixeira on the bench because of right hamstring tendinitis, the Yankees used what looked to be a not-so-imposing lineup.But the fill-ins did just fine, building a 3-1 lead after five innings.Dickerson hit a line drive into the second deck in right field in his first at-bat of the season.The center fielder also robbed Adam Jones of what might have been a two-run homer in the seventh inning with a leaping catch in front of New York\'s bullpen.Nick Swisher had an RBI single and made two fine plays at first base in place of Teixeira. He slammed into the wall to catch a foul pop while reaching into stands in the second inning and snared Nick Markakis\' scorching liner to end the third.Despite being 6-0 in seven starts since June 26 at home, Hughes, though, couldn\'t hold the lead.He walked Nate McLouth to start the sixth and Jones followed with a single. Wieters had an RBI single and Reynolds chased Hughes with a drive into the left-field bleachers, silencing a crowd that had been cheering what had been a dominant outing.Hughes has allowed 32 homers, tying him for the major league lead with the Angels\' Ervin Santana and Baltimore\'s Tommy Hunter. Hunter was demoted on Aug. 24. He is scheduled to be recalled Monday and will pitch out of the bullpen.Wolf yielded an RBI single to Swisher in the fifth but got help from shortstop J.J. Hardy\'s sparkling diving stab to start a double play in the sixth inning \xe2\x80\x94 one of three double plays for the Yankees. Released by the Milwaukee Brewers on Aug. 22, Wolf gave up three hits and walked one.""Wolfie, coming in and bringing some calmness \xe2\x80\x94 whatever you want to call \xe2\x80\x94 to the game was big,"" Manager Buck Showalter said.Derek Lowe walked Robert Andino with the bases loaded in the eighth, then walked off the field to loud boos. The Yankees used eight pitchers.Markakis added a two-run single in the eighth.""We\'re in the zone right now,"" Markakis said.NOTES: Reynolds has 17 multihomer games, three this season. ... Rodriguez went 0 for 7 in two rehab games for Class-A Tampa. He was scheduled to play Sunday but he was given the day off instead. Girardi said the third baseman could be activated from the DL on Monday. ... Orioles RHP Jason Hammel (right knee surgery) pitched five scoreless innings in a rehab start for Class-A Frederick on Saturday. He is scheduled to fly with the team to Toronto. Showalter said he will know what Hammel\'s next step is after his bullpen session this week. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 8, Yankees 3 - yahoo.com', 'NEW YORK -- Mark Reynolds had started this crucial series against the New York Yankees by telling skeptics of the Baltimore Orioles\' playoff chances to ""keep doubting.""  By the time it ended Sunday, with the Orioles\' 8-3 win at Yankee Stadium, Reynolds had helped eliminate most of the reasons to do so.  Reynolds hit two homers for the second time in the series and the Orioles piled on against the Yankees bullpen, while getting a strong effort from their own relievers after starter Chris Tillman was forced from the game with an injury.  The Orioles not only stunned the Yankees by taking two of three to move two games back in the AL East, they dominated them, leaving the perennial playoff team suddenly facing their own doubts.  Reynolds had said Friday night the Orioles didn\'t care about doubters, because ""we keep coming in and doing our jobs and doing the little things that win baseball games.""  On Sunday, as they did Friday, they did the little things, big things and in-between things to win a game.  Reynolds\' second homer of the game, and fourth of the series, was a three-run shot to chase starter Phil Hughes in the top of the sixth, and cap a four-run inning, giving the Orioles a 5-3 lead.  The blast wiped out a lead bolstered not by any of the Yankees\' stars, but September call-up Chris Dickerson, who hit a two-run shot for New York in the second. Dickerson also saved some runs with a pair of spectacular catches in center field, where he started for Curtis Granderson, out with tendinitis in his right hamstring.  In the bottom of the inning, the Orioles showed off the flashy defense that\'s helped them emerge into a playoff contender for the first time in 15 years. With a runner on first and one out, Russell Martin hit what looked to be a single up the middle. But shortstop J.J. Hardy dove to his right, flipped to second and Robert Andino fired to first.  The throw was wide, but Reynolds fully extended himself, just barely keeping a toe on the bag for an inning-ending double play.  Reynolds, who struggled earlier this season at the plate and with a move from third to first, killed the Yankees all series.  He finished 5-for-10 with four runs scored, four homers and seven RBI, while reaching base in seven of 12 plate appearances.  The Orioles lost Tillman after just three innings due to right elbow soreness but Randy Wolf (1-0) made his Orioles debut with 3 1/3 innings of one-run ball and three relievers shut the Yankees out from there.  Hughes (13-12) had allowed only Reynolds\' first homer, a solo shot in the fifth, entering the sixth. But he exited four batters into the sixth, having allowed five runs on eight hits.  ""He was just not making pitches,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""He was getting too much of the plate.""  Girardi then took advantage of his expanded roster to do plenty of his famed mixing and matching, using eight pitchers by the time he was done.  Least effective was Joba Chamberlain, who was saved by Dickerson\'s leaping catch at the wall to rob Adam Jones of at least an extra-base hit in the seventh, but gave up two runs in the eighth to give Baltimore a 7-3 lead. That pumped his ERA up to 10.57, before Derek Lowe gave up the final run, jacking up his ERA to 5.54.  NOTES: Yankees left-hander Andy Pettitte (fractured left ankle) threw a 35-pitch bullpen session Sunday, saying he was ""over the hump"" in his rehab after pushing off harder than he was able to in his first session last week. Manager Joe Girardi said the Yankees have begun planning a return schedule for Pettitte, but didn\'t offer a specific date. ... Girardi said there was a ""good chance"" Alex Rodriguez (fractured left hand) would return from the DL Monday. Rodriguez has gone 0-for-7 in two rehab games for Class A Tampa, but Girardi said he has not had any physical setbacks. ... Granderson could sit Monday as well, but might return after that. ... Orioles right-hander Jason Hammel (arthroscopic surgery, right knee) threw five scoreless innings and allowed three hits while striking out seven in his first rehab appearance Saturday night for Class A Frederick (Md.). Hammel could rejoin the Orioles and start Thursday\'s game against the Yankees in Baltimore, but manager Buck Showalter said the team will likely evaluate Hammel\'s next bullpen session before making a decision.

A real American hero ...', "" Thanks to an outstanding effort from Joe Saunders and the bullpen, today the Baltimore Orioles were able to overcome several missed chances on the basepaths to beat the Toronto Blue Jays by a score of 4-0. The win, combined with a loss by the New York Yankees, has pulled the Orioles to within just one game of first place in the AL East.  Joe Saunders didn't make the finest impression on the Orioles and their fans in his first start for the team, but he made up for it in a big way this afternoon. Saunders did not allow a baserunner until there were two outs in the sixth inning, which gave the O's offense plenty of time to build a lead. He induced lazy fly ball after lazy fly ball, and in fact the last five outs he recorded before giving up his first hit were fly balls to Adam Jones in center field.  As Saunders cruised through the first part of the game, Blue Jays' starter J.A. Happ had to work out of numerous jams. He put two runners on in the first inning thanks to a HBP and a walk, but they were stranded. Then to start the second inning Manny Machado hit a long fly ball to right field. There's no video of it on MLB.com, probably because it was scored an error, but it looked like a triple to me. Regardless of the official scoring, Machado was at third with no outs. Nate McLouth attempted to bunt his way on, but was thrown out thanks to a nice play by Happ. Machado came in to score, and so the play was scored a sacrifice bunt. Didn't look it though; he was trying to get a hit.  The O's wasted more baserunners in the third and fourth innings, but finally scored again in the fifth. Robert Andino singled to lead off, then back-to-back doubles from Nick Markakis and J.J. Hardy knocked in two runs to make the score 3-0. Hardy was in scoring position with no outs, and a sharp single to center field from Jones moved him to third base. It was a huge opportunity for the Orioles to break it open, but Happ came back and struck out Matt Wieters, Mark Reynolds, and Machado to strand both runners.     Another opportunity was lost in the sixth inning as the Orioles loaded the bases with just one out only to have Hardy ground into a double play. I tell you, the O's were lucky the pitching was on point, because they left a lot of guys out there today.     Speaking of the pitching, how about that Joe Saunders! He started the game with 17 up, 17 down before Adeiny Hechavarria hit a clean single into center field for the first baserunner of the day for the Jays. He followed that with a walk to Rajai Davis, but before I could panic too much about the tying run being at the plate, Colby Rasmus struck out.  The Orioles found themselves in a real bind in the seventh inning as a leadoff walk from Saunders and two seeing-eye singles into right field loaded the bases with one out. Buck Showalter called on Luis Ayala to clean up the mess, which makes every Orioles fan nervous. After all, Ayala lets inherited runners score about half the time. Not today, though. He went 3-0 on Sierra to get our hearts pounding, then struck him out on the next three pitches. A fly out from Jeff Mathis ended the inning and preserved the shutout.     After that close call the O's decided to tack on another run to give the bullpen a little breathing room.  With two outs, Hardy singled in Nate McLouth, who had reached on a HBP to start the inning. Andino was on third base representing the fifth run of the day, but Jones grounded out to end the inning.  Four runs proved to be more than enough for Pedro Strop and Jim Johnson to close out the game. Strop had looked shaky in recent games, including Saturday against the Yankees, but none of that was here today. Strop mixed up his pitches so that he was throwing 84 mph sliders next to 98 mph fastballs and struck out Hechavarria and Davis easily. Rasmus followed up the performances of his teammates with a one-pitch ground out to end the inning.  Johnson followed Strop's performance with his typical fare. It wasn't a save situation, but he needed some work having not pitched since last Thursday. He threw 11 pitches and retired the side in order. That's JJ.  And so, here we are on Labor Day and the Orioles are one game out of first place in the American League East. Somebody pinch me.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Chris Young)MoreTORONTO (AP) -- Joe Saunders began pondering perfection just one inning into his latest start.Saunders and three relievers combined on a three-hitter and the charging Baltimore Orioles blanked Toronto 4-0 Monday, cutting their AL East deficit to one game.''(Saunders) was the difference today,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.The Orioles, who took two of three at Yankee Stadium over the weekend, moved even closer to New York. The Yankees lost 4-3 at Tampa Bay.J.J. Hardy drove in two runs as the Orioles won for the eighth time in 10 games. The one-game gap marks the closest anyone has been to the Yankees since mid-June.Acquired recently from Arizona, Saunders (1-1) retired the first 17 Blue Jays batters before hanging a changeup to nine-hole hitter Adeiny Hechavarria, who lined a two-out single to center in the sixth.Saunders acknowledged he'd long been dreaming of the possibility of a perfect game or no-hitter.''You think about it,'' he said, smiling. ''I thought about it after the first. I was like 'Ooh, nice. I didn't give up a hit in the first.'''Baltimore, which had lost four in a row at Toronto, collected its eighth shutout of the season. The Orioles have won 20 of 28 overall.Saunders bounced back nicely from his Baltimore debut, when he allowed six runs in 5 1-3 innings in a loss to the White Sox.''When I got traded over here they had a great thing going,'' Saunders said. ''You just want to come over here and contribute as much as you can. You don't want to mess it up and get blown up a lot.''After Hechavarria's hit, Rajai Davis followed with a walk, but Saunders struck out Colby Rasmus to end the inning. Saunders allowed three hits in 6 1-3 innings. He walked two and struck out two.''Today he settled in a little bit more,'' catcher Matt Wieters said. ''He was definitely in control the whole game and was able to mix in different off-speed pitches.''Luis Ayala replaced Saunders after the Blue Jays loaded the bases with one out in the seventh. Ayala escaped by fanning rookie Moises Sierra and getting Jeff Mathis to fly out.Pedro Strop worked the eighth and Jim Johnson finished for Baltimore, who were playing their third straight day game and riding an emotional wave after their big weekend series in the Bronx.''I'm as proud of them today as I have been all year,'' Showalter said of his team. ''That's a challenge.''Adam Jones had two hits and Nick Markakis reached three times for the Orioles.The Orioles opened the scoring in the second when Manny Machado led off with a fly down the line in right. Fighting the sun and making a long run to the ball, Sierra couldn't come up with the sliding catch and was charged with a three-base error.''Obviously Moises had a difficult time with the sun in right,'' Blue Jays manager John Farrell said.Machado scored when Nate McLouth followed with a sacrifice bunt.Baltimore tacked on two more in the fifth on back-to-back RBI doubles by Markakis and Hardy. Blue Jays left-hander J.A. Happ avoided further damage by striking out Wieters, Mark Reynolds and Machado to strand runners at second and third.''They were able to manufacture a couple of runs but he made a number of key pitches to prevent a big inning,'' Farrell said.Hardy added an RBI single in the eighth.Happ (3-2) allowed three runs, two earned, and six hits in five-plus innings. He walked two and struck out nine.Brad Lincoln came on after McLouth doubled off the wall to begin the sixth. A walk, a sacrifice and an intentional walk loaded the bases for Hardy, but he grounded into an inning-ending double play.The Blue Jays, who were blanked for the seventh time this season, have lost three straight and 11 of 15.NOTES: Toronto recalled LHP Brett Cecil and activated RHP Jason Frasor (forearm) off the 15-day DL. ... The Orioles selected LHP Zach Phillips from Triple-A Norfolk and designated RHP Jason Berken for assignment. Baltimore also recalled RHP Tommy Hunter from Double-A Bowie. ... Blue Jays C J.P. Arencibia (right hand) has begun a rehab assignment at Class-A Dunedin and could rejoin the team by the end of the week, manager John Farrell said. ... The Orioles will recall RHP Zach Britton before Tuesday's game, allowing him to start against Toronto. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Birds Watcher: Baltimore Orioles: The \\u201cMark\\u201d of a winner', '\xc2\xa0Mark Reynolds has been one of the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 more maligned players this season by the fans. There\xe2\x80\x99s no doubt that Reynolds has had his moments, and in many cases it might be fair to suggest that more is expected from a player for whom the Orioles dealt a young pitching prospect in David Hernandez. However Reynolds has also produced big time for the Orioles as they\xe2\x80\x99ve moved through the second half of the season. Furthermore, he seems to rise to the occasion in games against Boston and NY (the latter being more important this year than the former). However to Buck Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s credit, he stuck with Reynolds throughout his slumps in the beginning part of the year, and that loyalty has paid off.Courtesy of Debby Wong, US PRESSWIREOver the weekend in New York, Reynolds provided Orioles fans with two different two-home run games, leading the Birds to taking two-of-three. Yesterday New York took a 2-0 lead on a home run by Chris Dickerson. Ironically, Dickerson was one of their September call-ups, and he was in the lineup because Curtis Granderson had a strained muscle. His at-bat in the second was his first big league at-bat of the season, and he promptly deposited a Chris Tillman fastball into the second deck of Yankee Stadium. However the Birds can never be counted out, and Reynolds taught people that yesterday once again. He started off with a solo shot in the fifth which brought the O\xe2\x80\x99s to within 2-1. After Matt Wieters\xe2\x80\x98 RBI-single in the sixth tied the score at two, Reynolds came to the plate once again with two on and nobody out\xe2\x80\xa6and I think you know the rest. Reynolds send another homer (this of the three-run variety) into the bleachers in left center field, bringing the boo birds out in the Bronx.MASN\xe2\x80\x99s Gary Thorne remarked at one point that it had been awhile since he had heard Yankee Stadium as quiet as it was over the weekend. While at the end of the game yesterday the silence was golden from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint, I\xe2\x80\x99m not sure \xe2\x80\x9cquiet\xe2\x80\x9d was how I\xe2\x80\x99d classify it. Those New York fans let you know when you aren\xe2\x80\x99t playing up to their standards! (And on a personal note, I do think it\xe2\x80\x99s bush league to boo the home team as a fan.) So again from the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 standpoint the silence was golden, as were the boos directed towards New York by their own fans. Moving into the eighth inning New York would use six different pitcher, and the Birds would tack on three more runs thanks to a bases loaded walk by Robert Andino and a two-RBI single by Nick Markakis.The one concern coming out of the game for the O\xe2\x80\x99s was Chris Tillman, who had to leave the game after three innings. Tillman was visibly uncomfortable on the mound, and later we found out that he had some elbow discomfort (which is never a positive sign). According to Roch Kubatko of masnsports.com, Tillman returned to Baltimore last night while the rest of the team headed to Toronto, and he\xe2\x80\x99ll have an MRI today. The preliminary stress tests on his elbow didn\xe2\x80\x99t appear to show any damage, but the MRI is merely a precaution. This is why the Orioles have loaded up on pitching depth, as you never know what can happen in a game. Randy Wolf made his Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 debut in relief of Tillman, and pitched 3.1 innings of relief (holding New York at bay by giving up three hits and a run). With the win, the Orioles now find themselves at 74 wins on the year (which was my prediction in terms of wins on the season overall), and two games behind New York in the AL East.The Orioles now head north of the border for a three-game series with the Toronto Blue Jays, with game one being at 1 PM this afternoon. Joe Saunders will make his second start (first on the road) for the Birds this afternoon, after being unimpressive his first time out last week. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by J.A. Happ, who\xe2\x80\x99s had similar problems as Saunders did last time out. He surrendered five walks to New York his last time out. Happ has a 4.77 ERA, and he came to Toronto in a ten-player trade prior to the non-waiver trade deadline.There\xe2\x80\x99s a lot going for this Oriole team behind the seams. While they\xe2\x80\x99ve certainly had their rough patches, they\xe2\x80\x99ve also been pretty steady all year. Furthermore, they\xe2\x80\x99ve seemed to have started to gel at just the right time. Several people wondered back in July if their play would continue until the end of the season, presumably ending in a playoff run. To me that wasn\xe2\x80\x99t such a huge question; the Orioles have always finished strong under Showalter. Why would we think that 2012 would be any different? For so many years the Orioles would play \xe2\x80\x9crespectable\xe2\x80\x9d ball in the first half of the season, only to fall into a mid-summer lull and ultimately tank in the second half (4-32 to close the season still stings for some fans). Then in 2010 and \xe2\x80\x9911 they started pretty lousy only to finish strong (again, 2-16 to start the year still stings for some fans). This time around they\xe2\x80\x99ve seemingly put it together for the entire time. There\xe2\x80\x99s still a lot of baseball to be played, but thus far you\xe2\x80\x99d be remiss of you didn\xe2\x80\x99t admit that the Birds don\xe2\x80\x99t have the \xe2\x80\x9cmark of a winner.\xe2\x80\x9d ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

PETERSBURG, Fla. \xe2\x80\x94 The Red Sox do collapses: memorably in 1978, destructively just last fall. The Mets do collapses \xe2\x80\x94 regularly, even what can feel like annually. The Phillies collapsed so dramatically in 1964, losing 10 games in a row to blow a six-and-a-half-game lead, that the performance stood for decades as a benchmark for choking.The Yankees, with their millions and their 27 titles, don\xe2\x80\x99t do collapses. Yes, yes, there was the embarrassing fold-up to the Red Sox in the 2004 playoffs, but that was a swift surrender that took only days. It was not anything quite like what the Yankees are in danger of doing this season: squandering, over many weeks, a 10-game advantage in the standings and with it, perhaps, a place in the postseason.One has to go back to 1933 to begin to find anything comparable. The Yankees gave up a six-game lead that season and finished second behind the Senators. But the large lead they held was on June 6, and the season was not even close to its midpoint. The Yankees ended up, in fact, finishing a full seven games behind the Senators.Sure, the Yankees have not been immune from crushing setbacks: the loss, in seven games, to Bill Mazeroski and the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1960 World Series, for instance, or the 2001 meltdown by Mariano Rivera in Game 7 of the World Series against Arizona that took place just weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks.

With the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 loss to Toronto, the Yankees took a one-game lead in the American League East.But the team was supposed to have been built to avoid this kind of potential embarrassment, the kind of losing that seems to feed on itself. The Yankees have the highest payroll in the sport; they have current or onetime All-Stars everywhere; they have a farm system that can be mortgaged to trade for a needed part.None of that, though, has seemed enough to stop a fall, one driven by a mix of injuries, poor clutch hitting, a lack of speed and a couple of tenacious, if unglamorous, rivals in the Rays and the Orioles.

Tampa Bay is 1 1/2 games behind the division co-leaders.\'\'We\'ve got too many bridges to cross, too many things to do, to accomplish the goal everybody had coming out of spring training,\'\' manager Buck Showalter said.Gonzalez (6-3, 3.31 ERA), who sat out the 2008 and 2009 seasons because of a knee injury and Tommy John surgery, was signed as a free agent in spring training and has been one of the team\'s most reliable starters lately.He is 3-1 with a 1.91 ERA in his last five starts, surrendering one home run in 33 innings in that span. The right-hander was masterful in a 6-1 victory at Yankee Stadium on Friday, striking out a career-high nine and scattering four singles over seven shutout innings.\'\'I think he\'s a guy that\'s just letting it fly and trusting himself,\'\' Showalter said. \'\'He doesn\'t have anything to lose.""Gonzalez gave up one run in 3 1-3 innings of relief in his lone appearance against the Blue Jays on May 29.A win in the finale would give the Orioles their first three-game sweep in Toronto since April 22-24, 2005. Baltimore is 9-4 against the Blue Jays this year, needing one more victory to win the season series for the first time since 2004.Toronto (60-75) is scoreless in consecutive games for the first time since May 2008. The Blue Jays have lost four in a row and 26 of 35.Brandon Morrow (8-5, 2.93) faces the Orioles for the second time in three starts since a lengthy absence. The right-hander limited the Rays to one run in 6 2-3 innings Friday in a 2-1 win, his first since June 11 after he was sidelined over two months with an oblique strain.He wasn\'t as sharp at Baltimore on Aug. 25 in his first start off the disabled list, yielding four runs - two earned - and six hits in 4 2-3 innings of an 8-2 loss.Morrow is 3-3 with a 4.79 ERA in eight starts against the Orioles.Adam Jones is 9 for 25 with two homers off Morrow, while J.J. Hardy is 5 for 12 with a pair of home runs.

(AP Photo/The Canadian Press, Aaron Vincent Elkaim)MoreTORONTO (AP) -- This is unfamiliar territory for the Baltimore Orioles, and they're just trying to roll with it.Mark Reynolds hit a three-run homer, Zach Britton pitched seven innings to win his fourth straight start and the Orioles moved into a first-place tie in the AL East with a 12-0 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Tuesday night.Baltimore's third consecutive victory coupled with the Yankees' loss at Tampa Bay gave the Orioles a share of first place in September for the first time since 1997, the last time they won the division and advanced to the playoffs.''We're just having a good time and we're not putting pressure on ourselves,'' Reynolds said. ''Everybody knows the situation we're in but we're just taking it day by day and having fun.''The Orioles also lead the AL wild-card chase, with the Rays 1 1/2 games back in the division and wild-card standings.''It's a big deal, obviously, but there's a lot of games left,'' Reynolds said. ''Us, the Yankees and the Rays are all right there. Oakland is having a good run right now. We can't take anything for granted.''Staying in the moment is something Orioles manager Buck Showalter has been preaching to his team.''We've got too many bridges to cross, too many things to do, to accomplish the goal everybody had coming out of spring training,'' Showalter said.Reynolds went 3 for 4 with four RBIs as the Orioles pounded out a season-high 18 hits.Recalled from Triple-A Norfolk to face the Blue Jays, Britton (5-1) allowed four hits and improved to 4-0 with a 0.94 ERA in four starts since his last loss on Aug. 1 against New York. The left-hander struck out eight and walked two, one intentional.''He's really in a good place right now,'' Showalter said. ''He was pretty relentless tonight, he kept pounding the zone.''Kevin Gregg worked the eighth and Zach Phillips finished for the Orioles, who have won 21 of 29.''We're not looking too far ahead,'' Britton said. ''We're focusing on the moment.''Struggling Toronto has dropped four straight and was held scoreless for the second straight game, the first time that's happened since May 2008. The crowd of 13,556 was the Blue Jays' smallest of the season.Reynolds hit his 17th homer off Carlos Villanueva in the fifth. It also was his fifth homer in five games.''I'm not even thinking,'' Reynolds said of his approach at the plate. ''I'm just going out, seeing the ball and hitting it.''Nate McLouth added a sacrifice fly in the sixth, and the Orioles pulled away with a three-run seventh. Robert Andino chased Villanueva with a sacrifice fly, Aaron Loup's balk scored Manny Machado and J.J. Hardy singled in Nick Markakis.Villanueva (7-5) lost for the fifth time in seven starts, allowing a season-high six runs and seven hits in 6 2-3 innings.Baltimore added five more runs against Loup and Chad Beck in a 10-batter eighth. Chris Davis hit an RBI double, Reynolds and Machado each singled in a run, Markakis tacked on an RBI double and McLouth capped the outburst with an RBI single. The Orioles left the bases loaded when Adam Jones grounded into a double play.Mechanical troubles with the retractable roof at Rogers Centre left the field slippery and damp during the middle innings as rain fell inside the stadium. The team apologized to fans after the roof was unable to close at the normal speed, leaving many people opening umbrellas to protect themselves from the elements.''I don't even know why they opened it in the first place,'' Reynolds said. ''It was raining outside all day.''Toronto broke a 31-year record for rainfall Tuesday, with the remnants of Hurricane Isaac dumping more than 1 1/2 inches of rain on the city by 2 p.m.Groundskeepers had to use drying agents on the mound and dirt cutouts around the bases before the bottom of the sixth as rain continued to fall on the infield.As the roof inched to a close, finally snapping shut in the bottom of the seventh, Britton exchanged jokes with catcher Matt Wieters and plate umpire Laz Diaz.''There was actually a point where it wasn't raining on the mound but it was raining behind the plate,'' Britton said. ''I was laughing at them because they had to wear it and I didn't.''Villanueva found it harder to see the funny side.''We were definitely not prepared for that,'' he said. ''It was a tough inning. My cleats were muddy.''The Blue Jays had a 26-minute delay in July 2003, when a sudden storm drenched the field before the roof could close during a game against the Chicago White Sox.NOTES: The shutout was Baltimore's ninth of the season, seven of which have come on the road. ... Orioles RHP Jason Hammel is expected to come off the 15-day disabled list to start Thursday in the opener of a crucial four-game series against the Yankees in Baltimore. ... Baltimore LHP Chris Tillman underwent an MRI. Tillman, who left after three innings of Sunday's victory over the Yankees, has no structural damage but is suffering nerve inflammation. It's not known when he'll pitch next. ... The Blue Jays recalled Beck and OF Anthony Gose from Triple-A Las Vegas. ...

In his house at the time, Showalter had myriad Yankees trinkets and mementos, from the glasses his children drank their morning juice out of to pictures of the three championship minor league teams he managed for the Yankees. Waiting to be unpacked was a picture of his 1995 Yankees, the first playoff team for the franchise in 14 years.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m not going to hide any of that stuff,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said in a telephone interview from his Florida home the day after his Yankees exit. \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m very proud of it. I\xe2\x80\x99m not employed by the Yankees anymore. That doesn\xe2\x80\x99t mean I\xe2\x80\x99m not still a Yankee.\xe2\x80\x9dOn Thursday, two hours before the Baltimore Orioles, Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s current employer, were about to play the Yankees in the first of four pivotal September games, Showalter was reminded of his 17-year-old comments.\xe2\x80\x9cAll that stuff isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting around my house now,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said, standing beside home plate inside Oriole Park at Camden Yards. \xe2\x80\x9cI was pulling for the Yankees for a long time.

Showalter, who began a seven-year minor league playing career when he signed with the Yankees in 1977, goes out of his way to say that he takes no special pride in beating his old team. Having the long-downtrodden Orioles in a pennant race conversation is accomplishment enough.

Showalter was not just pushed out the door in 1995 by George Steinbrenner, the team\xe2\x80\x99s principal owner, in a dispute over who got to pick the assistant coaches; he was also ignored in the search for a new manager after Joe Torre left the team following the 2007 season.Showalter was available, and while his r\xc3\xa9sum\xc3\xa9 had been blotted by imperfect stays in Arizona and Texas, it seemed odd that he was never even mentioned as a possible candidate for the job given to Joe Girardi. That is not to suggest that Showalter would have been the better choice, but it is na\xc3\xafve to think that Showalter was not miffed about never entering the picture. He had a 313-268 record as the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 manager after inheriting a 71-91 team.

He recalled that a 21-year-old Derek Jeter sat at the end of the bench a bit wide-eyed during Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s last game managing for New York, the defeat against Seattle in Game 5 of the 1995 A.L. division series.Out of sight but not mind was Andy Pettitte, a looming factor in this year\xe2\x80\x99s pennant chase who pitched in that Seattle series, as did Mariano Rivera. If Showalter is reminded, he has a wealth of stories about how tenuous the development of those now-famed late 1990s Yankees championship teams really was.

The owner was fed up with Williams\xe2\x80\x99s progress, while others wondered if Williams should stop switch-hitting. Showalter strongly advised against both steps.

Showalter and Gene Michael, the team\xe2\x80\x99s former general manager, stood firm. Many of those players eventually played key roles, and others became crucial in less remembered ways. Two players Showalter escorted through several years in the minors, pitcher Sterling Hitchcock and third baseman Russ Davis, were traded for Tino Martinez and Jeff Nelson in 1995.Showalter said he recently had time to sit down and talk informally with Torre.\xe2\x80\x9cIt was really the first time for something like that,\xe2\x80\x9d Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd I told him how proud I was of the high levels they had taken it to.

But on Thursday, in the teeth of a huge, unusually hostile crowd at Camden Yards, they did the improbable in the eighth inning.They scored five runs to silence the capacity crowd of 46,298, tying the game at 6-6. They jogged onto the field ready to do battle, with their best reliever on the mound. Perhaps this would be the elusive turning point the Yankees have sought for weeks.No sooner had they resumed their positions when wham, a solo home run to left-center field. Then, boom, a two-run shot down the left-field line. Finally, crunch, a solo shot to right. The Orioles had hit three home runs in the bottom of the inning to send the Yankees to a bruising 10-6 loss.In the first game of a four-game series, the Orioles drew even with the Yankees atop the American League East for the second time in three days in convincing fashion. The Yankees, 8-52 in games in which they trailed after seven innings, have lost 8 of 11 against Baltimore and over all they are 5-11 since Aug. 20. In games they trailed after eight innings, the Yankees are a hard-to-believe 0-52.

Looking somewhat overwhelmed by playing in a such a raucous environment in playoff-like conditions, Phelps surrendered five runs in four innings, and also issued a balk as he slipped off the rubber. It got so bad that the Yankees had Derek Lowe warming up in the bullpen.

Of course, these plans were made well before the Orioles barnstormed through the first five months of the season.Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s link to Ripken, who played on the last Baltimore team to reach the postseason, in 1997, was especially apt since the Yankees were in town to begin a four-game series with more meaning than any September games here since he retired in 2001.\xe2\x80\x9cBeing an Oriole,\xe2\x80\x9d Ripken told the crowd, \xe2\x80\x9cis about playing meaningful games in September.\xe2\x80\x9d The fans responded with a roar.

Their connection to a storied past was severed almost as soon as Manager Davey Johnson resigned after a 98-win season in 1997.

Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s homer was his 300th as a Yankee.Earlier in the week, Rodriguez said the team needed to rely more on small-ball techniques to win games because home runs do not win championships. He has a funny way of backing up his theory: on Friday night he hit a ball roughly 430 feet into the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 bullpen beyond the center-field wall.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Adam Jones had heard tales about how Camden Yards used to be when the place was packed and the Orioles were in a pennant race.With one dramatic swing of the bat, Jones found out for himself just how crazy the place can get.Jones hit the first of Baltimore's three home runs in a wild eighth inning, and the Orioles climbed back into a first-place tie with the Yankees in the AL East by defeating New York 10-6 Thursday night before a euphoric sellout crowd.Mark Reynolds had two of Baltimore's season-high six home runs. Matt Wieters and Robert Andino also connected for the Orioles, who have won 10 of 13 - a run that includes three of four over New York.Jones' leadoff homer in the eighth off David Robertson (1-6) put Baltimore ahead 7-6 after the Yankees rallied from a five-run deficit in the top half.''I've always asked our trainer, Richie Bancells, how loud can this place get? I always asked that,'' Jones said. ''After I hit that home run, he came up to me and said, 'That's how loud this place can get.'''Jones has hit many a game-winning home run, but none with the stakes so high.''That's the biggest hit I've ever had in my life. Everything else up to this point has been leading up to this,'' he said.Wieters followed with a single and Reynolds hit a drive into the left-field seats. Chris Davis then slammed the first pitch from Boone Logan over the right-field wall.After trailing the Yankees by 10 games on July 18, the surging Orioles pulled even Tuesday, then dropped a game back on Wednesday before taking the opener of this important four-game series.''They are playing with a lot of confidence right now,'' New York's Alex Rodriguez said. ''You have to tip your hat to Baltimore.''Reynolds, who also went deep in the sixth, has homered in three straight games and has eight long balls in his last seven, including two in each of the three wins against New York. With Reynolds leading the way, the Orioles hit a half-dozen home runs in a game for the first time since Aug. 28, 2007, against Tampa Bay.Baltimore has played several significant games in September in recent years, but this is the first time since 1997 that the Orioles have been in the hunt for a playoff berth. The fans reacted accordingly, cheering from the first pitch to the very end.''You couldn't ask for better,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''A special environment. Really appreciative. It helped. It was a real difference-maker for us.''The Yankees always attract huge crowds, but this time an estimated 90 percent of those in attendance were cheering for the home team. The full house and the boisterous orange-clad fans conjured memories of a time long ago, when Baltimore made two straight playoff appearances in 1996-97 prior to a run of 14 consecutive losing seasons.''It looked like a big tangerine,'' Jones said. ''I liked that.''New York trailed 6-1 in the eighth before mounting a comeback fueled by four walks. After Alex Rodriguez hit an RBI double and Curtis Granderson singled in a run, the Yankees put runners on second and third with two outs. The fans rose to their feet in anticipation after Pedro Strop prepared to throw a 1-2 pitch to Russell Martin, but Strop ultimately issued a walk to load the bases for pinch-hitter Chris Dickerson, who drew a four-pitch walk to make it 6-4.Ichiro Suzuki followed with his third hit, a two-run single, before Darren O'Day (7-1) got the final out.Yankees manager Joe Girardi derived little satisfaction from the comeback.''When you're playing a team for first place, a loss is a loss,'' he said. ''We swung the bats extremely well, but we didn't pitch well tonight.''Orioles starter Jason Hammel gave up one run and six hits in five-plus innings in his first outing since going on the disabled list in mid-July. The right-hander took a line drive by Robinson Cano off his elbow in the fourth, but stayed in the game.After Hammel warmed up the rowdy fans with a 1-2-3 first, three straight singles against David Phelps in the bottom half produced a run before Wieters hit an opposite-field, three-run drive to left for a 4-0 lead. It was his 19th home run of the season and the first since he connected off Phelps on Saturday.New York got a run in the fourth on Cano's hit off Hammel's arm and an RBI single by Granderson. In the Baltimore half, Andino hit his career-high sixth home run to make it 5-1.Reynolds made it 6-1 with a solo shot off Joba Chamberlain.NOTES: On the 17th anniversary of the day Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig's mark of consecutive games played, the Orioles unveiled a statue of the Iron Man in the picnic area beyond the center-field wall.

The first-base umpire, Jerry Meals, had just made an incorrect call, according to both the naked eye and television replays, and instead of the Yankees completing a comeback with Chris Dickerson crossing the plate to tie the score, the game was over.The Baltimore Orioles, according to Meals, had completed the game-ending double play with runners at first and third, and so they beat the Yankees, 5-4, in a memorable and contentious game at Camden Yards.For the sixth straight day, the Orioles toggled up and down in the standings again, coming from a game back to tie the Yankees in the American League East for the third time.Had the call at first base gone the other way, the Yankees would have tied the score and had a runner on first. But Teixeira would most likely not have been that runner because he said he reinjured his left calf muscle. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Teixeira, who also said he probably would not play Sunday, was so incensed after the game that he questioned the umpires\xe2\x80\x99 accuracy on that call and a strike call in the eighth.

They want to go home. Those were terrible calls.\xe2\x80\x9dYankees Manager Joe Girardi came a few steps out of the dugout to argue, but as the Orioles streamed out of the dugout to celebrate, blocking his path, he gave up the fight, at least for the moment.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was not the first time Girardi has had a confrontation after a loss. In Chicago last month, he yelled at, and approached, a fan who heckled him during a postgame interview.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  This particular argument stemmed from questions about the health of C. C. Sabathia.Sabathia did not pitch well again, giving up five runs and eight hits, including consecutive home runs by Mark Reynolds and Lew Ford and another by J. J. Hardy. Staked to a two-run lead, he gave that back and more and walked off the field trailing by 5-2 in the seventh. It was the third straight game in which Sabathia has surrendered a lead, and the Yankees have lost all three.At 13-5 with a 3.56 earned run average, his overall numbers appear impressive. But in the midst of a close divisional race, Sabathia is 0-2 with a 4.43 E.R.A. in his last three starts. Both he and Girardi insist his left elbow is not sore, but something seems to be wrong.

Privacy Policy    In a crowded interview after the game, Girardi, clearly upset from the loss and the bad call, was asked several times if Sabathia was healthy, in part because it was difficult to hear. Upon the third time, he grew irritated and was then told by Sherman that it was part of the job of being the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 manager to answer questions.Girardi seemed to think the repeated questions were more about getting him to tell the truth than the difficulty hearing, and he did not want to be told his job description.

The Yankees won 8-5. (AP Photo/Gail Burton)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- It's the time of year when milestones are far less important than victories, so for Alex Rodriguez, the significance of his 300th home run with the Yankees was solely that it helped New York regain sole possession of first place in the AL East.Homers by Rodriguez, Russell Martin and Steve Pearce provided New York with a seven-run cushion in the fifth inning, and the Yankees held on to beat the Baltimore Orioles 8-5 on Friday night.New York had lost eight of 11 to the Orioles, including the opener of this four-game series between division rivals that runs through Sunday.Rodriguez chased rookie Wei-Yin Chen with a two-run drive in the fifth - the 645th home run of his career. Only five players have more homers in a Yankees uniform than A-Rod, who obviously isn't keeping track of such things.''I had no idea I had 300,'' Rodriguez said. ''The only numbers we're worried about right now is Ws. Whatever you are going to do for the year is already done. The numbers are done. We're worried about one thing and that's winning games.''Rodriguez, who also singled, extended his hitting streak to 11 games - his longest run since a 12-gamer in 2009. Wearing the replica green University of Miami jersey of linebacker Ray Lewis (now with the Baltimore Ravens), Rodriguez seemed more interested in talking about the team than himself.''It was huge,'' Rodriguez said of the win. ''Every game from now on is huge, especially when you get to September. One of the challenges I have for the offense is that we should be able to score six runs every night. If we're disciplined and put up great at-bats, six runs is a good number.''The pitching was decent, too.Phil Hughes (14-12) allowed three runs, two earned, in six innings to end a streak of five straight road losses since June 15. The right-hander did, however, yield his 33rd home run, one less than Ervin Santana of the Angels, who gave up two Friday night.In his previous start, Hughes gave up five runs and two homers in five innings Sunday at Yankee Stadium in an 8-3 loss to the Orioles.Asked if he felt additional pressure pitching in a pennant race, Hughes said, ''I treated it like any other game. I tried to pitch the best ball game I could. That doesn't really change start to start. It was a good win for us.''Adam Jones, Robert Andino and Manny Machado homered for the Orioles, who got three hits from Nate McLouth but missed a chance to move ahead of the Yankees for the first time since June 7.Baltimore was backed by a near-sellout crowd of 40,861. But unlike Thursday night, when the Orioles hit six homers in a 10-6 win, most of the fans were silent at the end.''There was a lot of energy there again. The fans were great,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''Just a disappointment we couldn't return the favor.''Chen faced only 10 batters through the first three innings, only two more than he had to handle in New York's five-run fourth. Chen hit Nick Swisher on the foot with a pitch and walked Robinson Cano before Rodriguez struck out. Martin then pulled a 2-0 pitch into the left-field seats. One out and one single later, Pearce homered to left over the outstretched glove of McLouth, whose contention of fan interference was quickly dismissed by third-base umpire Mike Winters.For Pearce, who played earlier this season with Baltimore, it was his first home run with New York.After Rodriguez hit his 16th homer of the season in the fifth, Chen was done. The left-hander has surrendered 25 home runs in 28 games, including seven in his past four starts.''Actually I feel real good today,'' Chen said through an interpreter. ''I wasn't able to attack the strike zone like in the late innings, and that was the problem. This is the Yankees, and I made a couple of mistakes and they made me pay the price.''Jones gave Orioles fans some hope in the sixth when he connected with two on to cut the gap to 7-3. It was his 29th of the year and the second in two games.Andino homered off Cody Eppley in the seventh, but New York got that run back in the ninth on an RBI single by Derek Jeter. McLouth then robbed Swisher of a home run, leaping above the 7-foot wall to grab the ball out of the waiting hands of a fan in a Yankees shirt.Machado homered with two outs in the ninth.NOTES: Yankees 1B Mark Teixeira (strained left calf) intends to return Saturday. He has not played since Aug. 27. ... Baltimore recalled RHP Jake Arrieta from Triple-A Norfolk. He started on opening day for the Orioles but went 3-9 with a 6.13 ERA before being optioned. ... New York has been in first place every day since June 11. ... Rodriguez scored his 1,882nd run to move into a tie for 10th place with Tris Speaker on the career list. ... Matt Wieters went hitless, ending his 15-game hitting streak against the Yankees this season. ... New York's CC Sabathia will pitch Saturday against Baltimore's Joe Saunders. "", 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Yankees-Orioles Preview - Yahoo', 'CC Sabathia has spent the majority of his career dominating the Baltimore Orioles. This hasn\'t been a typical season, however, and that applies to the New York Yankees ace.Sabathia will try to avoid going winless in three consecutive starts for the first time this year as the Yankees seek to extend their slim AL East lead over the Orioles on Saturday night.After a wild 10-6 loss in the series opener dropped New York into a tie with Baltimore atop the division, the Yankees rebounded with an 8-5 victory Friday to regain a one-game advantage. Russell Martin hit a three-run homer in the fourth and Steve Pearce added a two-run shot later in the inning to back Phil Hughes\' strong start.Alex Rodriguez also went deep for the Yankees (78-60), who had homered just three times in losing four of their previous five. The win was New York\'s fourth in 12 road games overall, but its fifth in seven games this year at Baltimore.\'\'It was huge,\'\' Rodriguez said of the win. \'\'Every game from now on is huge, especially when you get to September. One of the challenges I have for the offense is that we should be able to score six runs every night. If we\'re disciplined and put up great at-bats, six runs is a good number.""There\'s no pitcher New York would rather have on the mound than Sabathia (13-4, 3.42 ERA), but even the six-time All-Star has discovered these Orioles aren\'t the same team that\'s endured 14 straight losing seasons.The veteran went 16-2 with a 2.74 ERA in his first 22 starts versus Baltimore but hasn\'t been nearly as sharp this season, going 0-1 with a 6.00 ERA in a pair of six-inning outings at Camden Yards.Sabathia is 1-1 with a 2.53 ERA in three starts since coming off the disabled list. He didn\'t receive a decision in a 4-3 loss at Tampa Bay on Monday, yielding three runs and eight hits in seven innings.Adam Jones is 13 for 38 (.342) with three homers against the left-hander while Robert Andino is 8 for 20 (.333) with one home run.Sabathia should get some added help with the expected return of first baseman Mark Teixeira, who has missed nearly two weeks with a strained left calf.""I just want to be smart,"" he said. ""I\'m ready to go. The team is ready for me to be back.\'\'Although Baltimore (77-61) lost for the fourth time in 14 games, it continued to pile up home runs against the Yankees. Jones hit his third in as many games, Andino homered in his second straight contest and Manny Machado also connected. The Orioles have 27 homers against the Yankees in 2012, their highest total versus New York in any season.Matt Wieters went 0 for 4 after hitting safely in all 15 games this year against the Yankees. He\'s batting .377 with four homers and eight RBIs in the season series.Joe Saunders (1-1, 4.63) hopes his third start more resembles his second appearance with the Orioles rather than his first. The left-hander retired the first 17 Blue Jays and allowed three hits over 6 1-3 innings in a 4-0 victory Monday.That was in stark contrast to his Orioles debut Aug. 29, when he was tagged for seven runs and 10 hits in 5 1-3 innings of an 8-1 loss to the White Sox.Saunders is 2-2 with a 5.77 ERA in seven career starts against the Yankees, the last two coming in the 2009 ALCS with the Los Angeles Angels.Left-handed hitting Raul Ibanez is 8 for 23 with two homers against Saunders, and Rodriguez is 7 for 14 with a pair of home runs.

Thirteen runs and a breezy victory will do that.The Yankees and the Orioles, the top two teams in the American League East race, played their final regular-season matchup, and the Yankees left town with a parting message: the offense is back.Even with Mark Teixeira lost again for an indefinite amount of time because of a calf strain, the Yankees pounded the Orioles, 13-3, to once again push Baltimore a game behind them in the A.L. East standings.The 13 runs were the second most the Yankees have scored this season, and the most since they beat the Red Sox, 15-9, on April 21 in Boston. The Yankees and the Orioles split this four-game series, as well as the season series, each winning nine games over all.

But there are distinct signs of an offensive renewal across the lineup.Granderson hit his 35th home run, added a single and a double, and collected five R.B.I.In the first six games of this trip, Granderson went 2 for 18 with no extra-base hits and nine strikeouts. But on Sunday, he homered to center field while pinch-hitting for Andruw Jones in the sixth, hit a two-run bloop single in the seventh, and then laced a bases-loaded, two-run double in the eighth.The home run was his 100th as a Yankee, and his 75th since the start of the 2011 season, the most in baseball.

He went 1 for 3 to extend his hitting streak to 13 games \xe2\x80\x94 his longest since 2007 \xe2\x80\x94 and is batting .308 (8 for 26) with two homers and six R.B.I. since Monday.All of it made Manager Joe Girardi much happier after the tension of the night before. On Saturday, he was incensed by a missed call by the first-base umpire, Jerry Meals, on the final play of the game. He then got into a screaming match with a reporter after the game. On Sunday, he said he still thought the call was wrong but added that the matter with the reporter was over.With the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 offense carrying the day, the mood on the team was far better.\xe2\x80\x9cYeah, guys were upset yesterday,\xe2\x80\x9d Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut other than that, I don\xe2\x80\x99t sense that there is any stress involved.

(AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBaltimore has walked a fine line all year in its surprising run to a share of the AL East lead.Without right fielder Nick Markakis, that margin of error got reduced further for the Orioles heading into Sunday\'s finale of their four-game set against the division co-leading New York Yankees.Manager Buck Showalter\'s team will finish with no worse than a split of its final series with New York (78-61), and Baltimore (78-61) again has a chance to wrest away the East lead following Saturday\'s tense 5-4 victory that improved its record to 25-7 in one-run games.Mark Reynolds, Lew Ford and J.J. Hardy all homered for the Orioles, who withstood a ninth-inning rally thanks to an incorrect call by first base umpire Jerry Meals as he called Mark Teixeira out on a close call that resulted in a game-ending double play.Television replays showed Teixeira beat the throw with his head-first slide, and the correct call would have resulted in pinch-runner Chris Dickerson scoring the tying run.""It was not a bang-bang play. He was safe. He was clearly safe,\'\' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ""You hate to lose a game that way, but he missed it.\'\'The play was costly for Sunday\'s game, too, as Teixeira aggravated a strained calf and is not expected to play.Baltimore\'s price for the victory, though, was much steeper. Markakis, batting .333 in the leadoff spot, will miss the rest of the regular season after suffering a broken left thumb from being hit by a CC Sabathia pitch.""It breaks my heart personally, and for him,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""I know how much this time of the season means to him. We\'ll go forward from there.\'\'Against the Yankees, that may mean more of the long ball from Baltimore, which has already hit 12 home runs in this series and could continue the trend versus scheduled New York starter Freddy Garcia (7-6, 5.09 ERA). The veteran right-hander struggled to keep the ball in the park in his last outing, an ominous sign considering Baltimore\'s hitter-friendly park.Garcia lost to Tampa Bay on Tuesday after giving up five runs - four scoring on three home runs - and five hits in 5 1-3 innings of a 5-2 loss.""That\'s my fault,"" Garcia told the Yankees\' official website. ""I gave up five runs; we lost, 5-2. Like I say, I don\'t make the pitch when I need it, and that\'s why I got hurt.""Garcia\'s 16 homers allowed in 99 innings match his total from 2011, when he logged 146 2-3 innings. He is 0-1 in four appearances - two starts - versus the Orioles this year, allowing three runs in six innings of a 5-4 defeat in a July 30 start.Reynolds, who has two home runs lifetime off Garcia, has seven in his last six games against New York after failing to hit any in his first eight. Hardy also has a pair of homers versus Garcia, and Adam Jones is 6 for 15 with three doubles.Zach Britton (5-1, 4.15) has been a surprise contributor to Baltimore\'s playoff run, winning four straight starts with a 0.94 ERA. His best outing in that stretch came Tuesday at Toronto, where he scattered four hits and two walks while striking out eight in seven innings of a 12-0 win after being recalled from Triple-A Norfolk.""He\'s really in a good place right now,\'\' Showalter said. ""He was pretty relentless (Tuesday), he kept pounding the zone.\'\'It was the Yankees, however, who were relentless in pounding Britton for seven runs in 2 2-3 innings of a 12-3 victory Aug. 1, the lefty\'s only loss this year. He is 1-2 with a 6.95 ERA in five career starts versus New York.

The Yankees won 13-3. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- The New York Yankees escaped from Camden Yards with their lead in the AL East intact, and as a bonus, slugger Curtis Granderson worked his way out of an annoying slump.Granderson came off the bench to hit his 35th homer and drive in five runs, and New York beat the Baltimore Orioles 13-3 Sunday to regain sole possession of first place in the division and earn an important split of the season series.Derek Jeter also homered for the Yankees, who lead the Orioles by one game with 22 left. Each team won twice in a four-game set that drew 173,572 fans, including 40,346 in the finale.''The bottom line is we're in first place,'' Yankees manager Joe Girardi said. ''The one thing that you want to be able to do is just rely on your club. You don't want to have to rely on other people.''Jeter, who had three RBIs and scored twice, said, ''We lost a couple games, but we did battle back. Today was a big one for us. We have a much-needed day off (Monday), then we go to play Boston. I like the way we played.''New York finished 9-9 against Baltimore this season. Had the Orioles won Sunday, they would have received home-field advantage in a playoff game if the teams finish tied atop the division. Baltimore would have also had home-field advantage if the Yankees and Orioles finish tied for both wild-card berths.Now, if the teams are tied at the end of the regular season, record within the division will be the tiebreaker.''We'll try to make it not matter,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.Granderson didn't start because he was stuck in a 5-for-43 skid. He entered as a pinch hitter in the sixth inning and hit a solo shot to put New York up 6-3, then delivered a two-run single in the seventh to provide the Yankees a five-run cushion.In the eighth, after Jeter hit a two-run drive off Kevin Gregg, Granderson doubled in two runs. The five RBIs matched a career high.''Any way to try and help the team out,'' Granderson said. ''Physically I have felt fine. Who knows what it's been? Just a matter of continuing to swing the bat. I've been getting good pitches; I just haven't been able to do anything with them. Just baseball being baseball.''Manager Joe Girardi couldn't have been happier.''It would be great to get him going because he has been so important to our offense,'' he said. ''For him to come in and get three hits and knock in five RBIs on a short day is pretty nice.''Pitching in relief of ineffective starter Freddy Garcia, Joba Chamberlain (1-0) entered in the fourth and worked 1 2-3 hitless innings to earn his first win since May 2, 2011. The right-hander was activated off the disabled list on Aug. 1 following elbow ligament replacement surgery in June 2011.Wilson Betemit had two RBIs for the Orioles, who were seeking to win the season series from New York for the first time since 1997.The best news of the day for Baltimore, perhaps, was that right fielder Nick Markakis may not be sidelined as long as anticipated with a broken left thumb, the result of being hit by a pitch from CC Sabathia on Saturday. The right fielder was expected to be sidelined for six weeks, but a surgical procedure Tuesday could hasten the recovery time.''September is not an option, so we've got to hopefully play good baseball and make October an option,'' Showalter said.Nate McLouth batted leadoff for Baltimore, going 0 for 2 with two walks and a stolen base in place of Markakis.Orioles starter Zach Britton (5-2) allowed five runs, five hits and five walks in 3 1-3 innings. The left-hander was 4-0 with a 0.94 ERA in his previous four starts.''I felt like when I commanded the ball in the zone, I got the outs that I wanted,'' Britton said. ''So I kind of just beat myself around today with the walks.''The Yankees got a first-inning run when Jeter beat out a chopper to third and scored on a two-out RBI single by Robinson Cano.New York benefited from four walks in a four-run fourth. After a single and two walks loaded the bases, Britton walked Steve Pearce to force in a run. Jayson Nix and Ichiro Suzuki hit RBI singles before Jeter ended Britton's outing with a bases-loaded walk. Jake Arrieta then struck out Nick Swisher and Alex Rodriguez.Baltimore answered with three runs in the bottom half. Garcia walked McLouth and hit J.J. Hardy with a pitch before Betemit doubled in two runs and Matt Wieters chased Garcia with an RBI single.NOTES: Yankees 1B Mark Teixeira re-injured his left calf Saturday night on the final play of the game.

Rodriguez extended his hitting streak to 13 games, his longest run since an 18-gamer in April 2007. ... Swisher went 0 for 4 and is hitless in his last 28 at-bats, part of a 2-for-43 funk. ...

When I say everything, I mean literally everything\xe2\x80\xa6including the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 5-4 win over New York last night to pull even in the AL East once again. In the last of the 5th Nick Markakis was hit on the wrist by an 0-2 CC Sabathia pitch, and head trainer Richie Bancells came out of the dugout quick. When you saw him spend very little time with Markakis on the field before the two of them headed towards the clubhouse, you knew it was bad. Nick Markakis doesn\xe2\x80\x99t willingly leave games. Later on we got word that he had a broken left wrist, and would miss the remainder of the regular season.Markakis came back onto the bench later on and MASN cameras caught manager Buck Showalter hugging Markakis near the tunnel; Showalter was visibly moved on Markakis\xe2\x80\x99 behalf after the game as well. Showalter did say that if the Orioles progressed deep into the postseason there was a chance that Markakis could return to the team, however at the moment the goal is to get to the postseason. And the Orioles will have to do that without the guy that\xe2\x80\x99s been one of the best lead off hitters in baseball since returning from injury in July. Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s comment about winning without Markakis was that he\xe2\x80\x99s only one piece of the team, and he most certainly has a point. It\xe2\x80\x99s almost a next-man-up mentality when someone gets hurt like this in a pennant race; it just makes the road a lot tougher.New York put two runs on the board in the first two innings to take an early lead, however these are still the Fighting Showalters we\xe2\x80\x99re talking about. Mark Reynolds continued his hot streak against New York with a solo shot in the last of the second, and that was immediately followed by another solo homer by \xe2\x80\x9cSweet Lew\xe2\x80\x9d Ford. The O\xe2\x80\x99s took the lead in the third as Nick Markakis scored on Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s RBI-double, and suddenly the Orioles had the lead in this all-important game before a sellout crowd at the yard. Hardy would later homer and Jones would later score on a Lew Ford RBI-single, both in the 6th, to give the Birds a 5-2 lead.Remember folks, these are the New York Yankees about whom we\xe2\x80\x99re talking here. They don\xe2\x80\x99t just go away for the most part, evidenced by Alex Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x98s solo homer off of Pedro Strop in the 8th. Strop was later lifted in favor of Brian Matusz, but he\xe2\x80\x99s certainly had a rough go of it late in that he can\xe2\x80\x99t seem to located his fastball. As we moved to the last of the ninth, NY managed to put a run across against Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 closer Jim Johnson, and they loaded the bases with one out and Maryland native Mark Teixeira coming to the plate. Teixeira would send a grounder (which was no doubt slowed by the wet infield grass due to the rain earlier in the night) to Andino who got the out at second base. Hardy\xe2\x80\x99s relay back to first was going to be a bang-bang play, and to Teixeira\xe2\x80\x99s credit he layed out head first trying to beat the throw to the bag. And for the record, he did beat the throw\xe2\x80\xa6but was called out. Game over, Orioles win.Having said all of this, I\xe2\x80\x99m a person that can be very critical of umpires and referees, in true Earl Weaver/Gary Williams fashion. The Orioles are a team that has seemingly seen more bad calls over the course of the season with regard to the strike zone or even safe/out than many of us have ever seen. Yet when the mighty Yankees are suddenly the team that\xe2\x80\x99s affected, we never seem to hear the end of it. Both Mark Teixeira and manager Joe Girardi were extremely critical of the call. One reporter even asked Girardi if it was especially bad to lose to\xc2\xa0that team on a call like that. (An underhanded dig at the O\xe2\x80\x99s perhaps?) If you\xe2\x80\x99re the Orioles you\xe2\x80\x99d rather win without the ump making a bad call in your favor, but as we\xe2\x80\x99ve said so many times when the shoe\xe2\x80\x99s been on the other foot, there isn\xe2\x80\x99t much that you can do about it except play on. There were also multiple reports that Girardi got into a nose-to-nose argument with NY Post reporter Joel Sherman in his office after the game, and the two had to be separated by ballpark security.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-US PRESSWIREThe concern for the O\xe2\x80\x99s right now is the lead off spot and who\xe2\x80\x99s playing right field. My personal opinion is that Nate McClouth should lead off and play left semi-regularly, and that several folks (including Chris Davis) should see some time in right. The Orioles also have the young and quick Xavier Avery on the bench, who was a September call-up, and I suspect that he might figure into the mix as well. If there\xe2\x80\x99s one thing that Showalter\xe2\x80\x99s done it\xe2\x80\x99s manager the mix of players in a virtuoso manner this year, and Oriole fans should have no reason to think that won\xe2\x80\x99t be the case again now. Markakis was no doubt an important piece of the puzzle, however the key could now be McClouth. He\xe2\x80\x99s played lights out since coming to the O\xe2\x80\x99s in early August, and I think that his bat and veteran presence will figure prominently in the post-Markakis stretch here in September.The O\xe2\x80\x99s have a chance to take three-of-four this afternoon if they can pull out another win against New York, and they\xe2\x80\x99ll send Zach Britton to the mound in hopes that he can quiet their bats. He\xe2\x80\x99ll be opposed by NY\xe2\x80\x99s Freddy Garcia. If the Orioles can win today, they\xe2\x80\x99ll go into Monday\xe2\x80\x99s off day alone in first place by one game in the American League East. ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

', 'www.nytimes.com'), ('Orioles 9, Rays 2: Party Hardy, back into first place ...', ' They\'re not all going to be this easy. But man, it sure is fun when they are.Squaring  off against a division and wild-card rival that\'s nipping right at  their heels, the Orioles leveled a resounding beatdown on the Tampa Bay  Rays tonight, enjoying a rare blowout victory that was essentially  decided by the third inning. The O\'s sat back and let J.J. Hardy put on a  show with his most stupendous performance of the season, a four-hit,  two-homer, five-RBI one-man slugfest that-- coupled with the Yankees\'  loss in Boston-- brought the Birds back into a first-place tie in the AL  East. Only a Jason Hammel injury soured what was otherwise a  magnificent night of Orioles baseball.Tonight\'s  game started off just swimmingly. Do people still say ""swimmingly""? All  right, let\'s rephrase: everything was just peachy-keen. Jason Hammel  cruised through the first two innings-- six batters up, six batters  down-- before he had his lone hiccup by allowing a Ryan Roberts solo  homer in the third. Still, the Orioles staked him to a lead thanks to  one run that was gift-wrapped by the Rays and two others that were  earned by more conventional means.In  the bottom of the first, Adam Jones drew a two-out walk from Rays  starter Matt Moore. Then Matt Wieters popped a duck-snort blooper to  shallow right. The ball fell in safely just inside the foul line and  just in front of right fielder Matt Joyce. Jones scampered to third and  was prepared to hold there, but Joyce somehow muffed the ball, even  though it had basically stopped moving by that point. Jones turned the  jets back on and dashed home, crossing the plate before a bewildered  Joyce had a chance to react. Ruled a single and E9, it gave the O\'s a  1-0 lead.Two  innings later, J.J. Hardy began his huge night by crushing a two-run  blast into the left-field seats, giving him a 20-homer season for the  fourth time. In fact, he parked that one just a couple sections over  from where his biggest fan was sitting. That one\'s for you, Stacey! Speaking  of which, the whole left-field lower deck-- along with all other  sections in which the O\'s are offering special discounted seats for this  series-- was almost completely packed. The rest of the stadium? Not so  much. The total attendance for the night was 23,828, though not many of  them were in the upper and middle decks. Take note, Orioles marketing  department: the fans clearly will come out to the yard when the price is  right. Slashing prices in certain sections is a good start, but there\'s  still a ways to go. The next step is-- oh, I don\'t know-- how about  getting rid of that annoying day-of-game surcharge for fans who want to  walk up and buy tickets?Anyway...I  teased earlier that there was some bad news for the Orioles, and it  happened in the top of the fourth inning. After Hammel retired the first  two batters, he walked Evan Longoria, and the Orioles saw something in  Jason\'s delivery that they didn\'t like. Buck Showalter, Rick Adair, and  trainer Richie Bancells jogged to the mound to confer with the  right-hander. After a brief discussion, Hammel headed off the mound,  finished for the night after just 3 \xe2\x85\x94 innings. His ailment was listed as  a ""right knee injury,"" which sounds vague but is unlikely to be good  news, considering that it\'s the same knee on which he just had surgery.  Without knowing anything more at the moment, we can only hope it was  just a minor tweak and Hammel was only removed as a precaution.  Otherwise, the Orioles are facing the prospect of losing their best  starting pitcher just as the pennant race comes to a full boil.Long  reliever Steve Johnson inherited a 1-0 count on Joyce and walked him,  but then struck out Ben Francisco to strand two runners. Johnson walked  another in the fifth but again ended the inning on a strikeout. I  would\'ve liked to see Steve work another inning, but Showalter continued  the bullpen parade in the sixth by bringing in Luis Ayala. Ayala and  Brian Matusz combined on a scoreless sixth and seventh, so I guess Buck  knew what he was doing.Meanwhile,  the Orioles continued to pile on the runs. They did a great job against  the impressive young lefty Moore, exhausting him for an incredible 94  pitches in just four innings. Then they jumped on his replacement, Burke  Badenhop, for three straight hits to start the fifth, capped by a  Wieters two-run double that made it a 5-1 game.There  wasn\'t a single Rays reliever who had a scoreless outing tonight. Cesar  Ramos coughed up a run in the sixth on a Hardy RBI single. J.P. Howell surrendered a Chris Davis solo homer in the seventh. And against Dane de  la Rosa in the eighth, the amazing J.J. struck again. Hardy stepped to  the plate already 3-for-4 on the night, a triple shy of the cycle. He  didn\'t get the triple-- but he did one better. Hardy launched another  fly ball deep into the night, again depositing it into the left-field  seats for his second homerun of the night.Are  you kidding me?? What a night for J.J.! A 4-for-5 night with two  homeruns, five RBIs, and 11 total bases. It\'s the first time he\'s driven  in five or more runs since 2007, and it\'s his ninth career multi-homer  game (his only other multi-homer game this year was the infamous Chris Davis Winning Pitcher marathon at Fenway on May 6).Staked  to a huge lead, for once the O\'s didn\'t have to sweat out their final  few innings. Darren O\'Day pitched the eighth inning-- with a meaningless  Elliot Johnson homer his only blemish-- and Pedro Strop worked a  scoreless ninth in a low-pressure, boost-your-confidence outing. The  Birds did their part, and about 15 minutes after this game ended, the  Yankees suffered a walkoff defeat at Fenway Park. Ladies and gentlemen,  we\'re all tied up again atop the AL East, for the fourth time in the  last week. On Wednesday the Birds will get another chance to take sole  possession, and O\'s fans are granted full permission to absolutely flip  out if they do.

Dan Connolly of The Baltimore Sun tweeted the following, and the rest of the season will not be the same:  Things we are hearing: LJ Hoes is here; Kevin Gregg has left the stadium with his suitcase -- we\'ll be down in the clubhouse soon \xe2\x80\x94 Dan Connolly (@danconnollysun) September 11, 2012     Perhaps you have dreamed of this day. I have dreamed of it. I feel bad for celebrating a baseball player\'s misfortune in this way at times. All the way back in January, in a conversation with one of the Orioles writers at Fanfest, I mentioned that Gregg was obviously not much liked by the fans, and was told that reporters, at least, appreciate that he will take his lumps and give out quotes after a bad game. I guess that\'s nice for a reporter, but when you\'re a fan of the team Gregg pitches on, and those quotes are things like, ""(Jorge Posada) had to do a lot of things right to hit that pitch out at this point in his career,"" you just don\'t like him much. Gregg\'s tenure in Baltimore comes to a close after not quite two full years. He pitched in 103 games, threw 103.1 innings and had a 4.53 ERA. That cost the Orioles $10 million. Thanks, Andy MacPhail. You were good at some things, but signing relievers was not one of them. Gregg walked 64 batters in those innings and had a 1.655 WHIP in his Orioles playing time. Andrew noted on this week\'s Camdencast that Tampa Bay will probably sign Gregg next year and get him to pitch to a 2.00 ERA. I would not be shocked.    The reason Gregg was sent packing is because the Orioles have called up L.J. Hoes, who\'s been a subject of some excitement for Orioles fans since he was drafted in the third round in 2008 in part because he is a relatively local kid - he went to high school in Washington, D.C. - and in part because he has an awesome name. This year there was some more excitement. After the prospect-industrial complex had seemed to give up on Hoes, he went ahead and batted .300/.374/.397 in 82 games with Norfolk this year. He is only 22 years old, and, with the Orioles short on outfielders, he may find a little time to shine. Don\'t get your hopes up too much, though, because the Orioles are also returning Endy Chavez to the big league club. He was off the 40-man roster, which necessitated another player to be sent to the great DFA in the sky. That player was Ryan Adams. You may have forgotten he existed. If Dan Duquette thought he had any value at all, he would be here and not Omar Quintanilla. So long, Ryan, and good luck where life next takes you, unless that place is playing against the Orioles in the future, in which case I hope you fail. Hoes up, Gregg out, and the Orioles still reside in a wild card spot on September 11 with three games to play against the Rays starting tonight. So far, this is a good day. May it stay that way.

Sure, the Red Sox and Braves\xe2\x80\x99 collapses last year were oodles of fun for anyone not a Red Sox or Braves loyalist, but the beneficiaries were the Rays and the Cardinals. O.K., the Rays can claim a little bit of charm despite that dreadful ballpark and its empty seats, but they are so four years ago.This year, though, the Orioles have dropped in right out of charm\xe2\x80\x99s central casting to tie the Yankees atop the American League East. Not only had everyone outside of Baltimore forgotten until the second half of the season that they field a team, but they have the added benefit of fielding almost nobody you\xe2\x80\x99ve heard of \xe2\x80\x94 and one you have, Jim Thome, is on the disabled list. More players you haven\xe2\x80\x99t heard of keep dropping like flies to injury and the Orioles are winning anyway. And they\xe2\x80\x99re tied with the Yankees. What\xe2\x80\x99s not to love?Mike Knobler of CBSSports.com compares them to the 2008 Rays, who defined underdog charm back then, and Jon Paul Morosi writes on Foxsports.com that they are defying every sort of baseball logic by just being here. They aren\xe2\x80\x99t complaining about the bad timing of their injuries, writes Peter Schmuck in The Baltimore Sun, because it wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t do any good and would cost them serious underdog points. Of course, it does not take much to be an underdog against the Yankees, who as Ken Davidoff writes in The New York Post, are not staging a classic Red Sox-like dive, but they\xe2\x80\x99re wheezing enough to unsettle those rooting for the empire. And the fact that the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 driver crashed their bus leaving Fenway Park on Tuesday night feels eerily symbolic.O.K., for a moment though, even the Yankees can feel thankful they are not the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 Joe Nathan, a Giants fan who lost a bet and had to take batting practice in a Tony Romo uniform. Ouch.

It instantly turned its World Cup qualifying prospects brighter, writes Avi Creditor on SI.com, but as Martin Rogers writes on Yahoo.com, it is still hard to tell just where this team is headed.

But while enthusiasm still reigns in places like Humboldt State, Matt Krupnick writes in The Times, high school football may be feeling the effects of the concussion epidemic first, Tim Keown writes on ESPN.com.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  College sports, as always, have their issues, although the recent ones keep ratcheting up the scale of sports run amok. The latest news at Penn State is former offensive coordinator Mike McQueary\xe2\x80\x99s suing the school in a whistle-blower case, the latest accusation that the school has botched the handling of the Jerry Sandusky matter. And new shenanigans have cropped up at shenanigans headquarters, North Carolina. While investigating an academic scandal, the school stumbled upon some cozy personal trips by two of its fund-raisers, one of whom happens to be Tyler Hansbrough\xe2\x80\x99s mother. Not even Harvard is immune, with two of its basketball players reportedly leaving school after being ensnared in that school\xe2\x80\x99s stunning cheating scandal.With all of that going on, no wonder the Orioles feel so charming.

The only reason, though, is because he is playing center field at Fenway Park this week and can hear the out-of-town digits sliding into their squares in the Green Monster.\xe2\x80\x9cI get a chance to look at all of them,\xe2\x80\x9d Granderson said. \xe2\x80\x9cIf there\xe2\x80\x99s nothing going on, I can hear when they put the different numbers in.\xe2\x80\x9dGranderson hung a few numbers of his own on the Yankees-Red Sox linescore behind left field. He homered twice to help the Yankees to a 5-4 victory, preserving their first-place tie with the Baltimore Orioles, who beat the Tampa Bay Rays at Camden Yards.When his eyes were on the action, Granderson watched an impressive performance by Yankees starter David Phelps. After Jarrod Saltalamacchia tripled to Granderson\xe2\x80\x99s center-field neighborhood, leading off the fifth, Phelps kept him stranded with a strikeout, a pop out and another strikeout. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s big,\xe2\x80\x9d Granderson said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe all believe in him, but it\xe2\x80\x99s one thing to go out there and do it yourself and know that you can get out of jams, and he was able to do that tonight.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Phelps, 25, was no higher than eighth on the depth chart of starters in spring training. The Yankees started the season with C. C. Sabathia, Hiroki Kuroda, Phil Hughes, Ivan Nova and Freddy Garcia. Michael Pineda was out for the year with shoulder trouble, and Andy Pettitte was working himself into shape after coming out of retirement in March.Now, Phelps is starting pivotal games for a team that had a 6.33 starters\xe2\x80\x99 earned run average in September before Wednesday. He is trying to avoid becoming the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 version of poor Kyle Weiland, the overmatched rookie who started three games for Boston, all losses, as the Red Sox fell apart last September.

Credit             Jared Wickerham/Getty Images           Phelps had failed to last five innings in his first two starts this month, walking eight in eight and two-thirds innings. But he made it through five and two-thirds Wednesday, allowing a run, five hits and only one walk.

He said he would play Thursday, and to Jeter, that\xe2\x80\x99s all that matters.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Jeter has always drawn clear lines of distinction between injured and hurt. An injured player cannot play, period. A player who is hurt can still play, because everybody is hurt. And if a player is playing, there can be no excuses.

They overcame the loss of closer Mariano Rivera in May \xe2\x80\x94 it helped to have an $11 million setup man, Rafael Soriano, as a replacement \xe2\x80\x94 but losing Pettitte in June knocked the Yankees from their rhythm.The Yankees won the day Pettitte fractured a bone just above his ankle, on June 27, improving to 46-28. From that point on, they are 34-34 \xe2\x80\x94 and, of course, they have lost 10 games in the standings since July 18.The depth the Yankees seemed to have in spring training, when Pettitte joined what looked like a deep stable of starters, is long gone. Larry Rothschild, the pitching coach, had a feeling the Yankees would need every starter they could find.

Hardy homered twice, doubled and drove in five runs, and the Orioles defeated the Tampa Bay Rays 9-2 Tuesday night to move into a tie for the AL East lead.But starting pitcher Jason Hammel left in the fourth inning with an injured right knee. The right-hander underwent arthroscopic surgery on that same knee in mid-July and was making his second start since returning from the disabled list.Hammel will be examined Wednesday by the team surgeon. He said the sensation was exactly identical to what he felt in a July 13 game against Detroit, his last start before going on the DL.""It\'s a very sharp pain in the knee in the same spot,"" Hammel said. ""I\'m hoping it is just scar tissue. I\'ve been told scar tissue can react like that.""On Saturday, Baltimore lost right fielder Nick Markakis with a broken left thumb while defeating the New York Yankees. Both Hammel and Markakis were on the DL earlier this year.""We\'ve been down this road many times this year with a lot of different challenges,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""We\'ve operated a good portion of this season without Ham and without Nicky, so we\'re kind of experienced at it anyway. It\'s not the kind of experience you want to have.""Hammel had no problem with the knee on Thursday night against the Yankees, and retired 11 of 13 Tampa Bay batters before exiting.""Against the Yankees, I felt great,"" Hammel said. ""I felt like I was back on track, and I know I can help this team when I am healthy. So it\'s very frustrating.""Steve Johnson (3-0) got the win with 1 1-3 innings of hitless relief.With Markakis out, Hardy picked up the slack. He went 4 for 5 to help Baltimore pull even atop the division with the Yankees, who lost 4-3 at Boston. The Rays are two games behind the co-leaders.Hardy hit a two-run homer in the third inning, doubled and scored in the fifth, singled in a run in the sixth and added his 21st homer with a runner on in the eighth. It was his ninth career two-homer game, the second this season.""I got a couple pitches to hit and didn\'t miss them,"" Hardy said.Chris Davis homered and Matt Wieters had three hits and two RBIs for Baltimore.Ryan Roberts and Elliott Johnson hit solo homers for Tampa Bay. It was the first time since Aug. 4 that the Rays lost by more than two runs; eight of their previous 12 defeats were by one run.""Anybody can get beat by a lot of runs any night,"" Roberts said. ""It didn\'t go our way tonight, and that\'s how it happens sometime in baseball.""Roberts left in the sixth inning with a left forearm strain, the result of a tag he made at second base. X-rays were negative, and he held out hope of playing Wednesday in the next game of the three-game series.""I\'m just glad it isn\'t broke,"" Roberts said. ""If it\'s up to me, I\'m playing. We\'re in a tight race and these games mean a lot, so I definitely want to play even if it\'s going to hurt a little bit.""Tampa Bay left-hander Matt Moore (10-10) threw 94 pitches over four innings before being lifted by manager Joe Maddon. Moore allowed two earned runs on four hits and three walks.Burke Badenhop entered with a run of eight straight scoreless appearances and promptly gave up a double to Hardy, a single to Adam Jones and two-run double to Wieters that provided Baltimore with a 5-1 lead.Hardy\'s sixth-inning RBI single came off Cesar Ramos and Davis hit his 25th homer in the seventh off J.P. Howell.Johnson connected against Darren O\'Day leading off the eighth, and Hardy homered off Dane De La Rose in the bottom half.The victory improved Baltimore\'s record against AL East foes to 33-24 compared to 28-44 last year.Baltimore broke on top with an unearned run in the first inning. Jones walked and scored when Matt Joyce fumbled Wieters\' two-out single to right.Hammel retired the first eight batters before Roberts connected in the third. It was his fourth homer with Tampa Bay since in coming over in a trade with Arizona on July 24.In the bottom half, Robert Andino led off with a double and Hardy homered to put the Orioles ahead for good.NOTES: Baltimore leads the season series 7-6 and took the lead in the all-time series, 127-126. ... The Orioles purchased the contracts of OFs Endy Chavez and L.J. Hoes and designated RHP Kevin Gregg and INF Ryan Adams for assignment. ... This was the first of 15 consecutive games against AL East foes for the Rays, who head to Yankee Stadium after this series. ... The Rays will send Alex Cobb to the mound Wednesday night and the Orioles will start rookie Miguel Gonzalez, who\'s 0-1 with a 6.52 ERA in two starts against Tampa Bay. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Rays-Orioles Preview - Yahoo', 'Once again, the Baltimore Orioles have a chance to grab sole possession of first place in the AL East.That\'s if they can end Alex Cobb\'s recent run of success for the Tampa Bay Rays.Making his first appearance against the Orioles, Cobb tries to help the Rays even their three-game set at Camden Yards on Wednesday night.J.J. Hardy homered twice and had five RBIs in Baltimore\'s 9-2 win over Tampa Bay on Tuesday. The victory moved the Orioles (79-62) into a first-place tie with New York, which split a four-game set at Camden Yards over the weekend but lost 4-3 at Boston on Tuesday.Baltimore, however, might have lost another key contributor after starter Jason Hammel left in the fourth inning Tuesday with a knee injury. The Orioles are without right fielder Nick Markakis for the rest of the regular season after he suffered a broken left thumb Saturday.""We\'ve been down this road many times this year with a lot of different challenges,\'\' manager Buck Showalter said. ""We\'re kind of experienced at it anyway.\'\'Tampa Bay (77-64), which has dropped three of five after winning four in a row, is two games behind the division co-leaders. Tuesday\'s defeat was the first time since Aug. 4 that the Rays lost by more than two runs.""It didn\'t go our way, and that\'s how it happens sometime in baseball,"" said infielder Ryan Roberts, who hit a solo homer.The Rays hope Cobb (9-8, 4.28 ERA) can help them bounce back and possibly make up ground in the division. The right-hander is 5-0 with a 3.25 ERA in seven starts - all Rays wins - since posting a 5.11 ERA while losing three straight from July 16-27.He allowed a two-run homer and three other hits in seven innings of a 5-2 win over the Yankees on Sept. 4.Cobb faces a Baltimore lineup that pounded out 13 hits Tuesday, including three homers. Matt Wieters went 3 for 3 with two RBIs while Chris Davis added to his career high with his 25th home run. Wieters is 4 for 6 in the last two games, and 6 for 14 in his last four against the Rays.Hardy is batting .327 (16 for 49) versus Tampa Bay this season, and .387 (12 for 31) with three homers and 10 RBIs in his last eight games overall.Baltimore starter Miguel Gonzalez (6-4, 3.62) allowed two hits and overcame four walks to last seven innings in a 1-0, 10-inning win at Tampa Bay on Aug. 5. It was much better than his first look at the Rays at home July 25, when he was roughed up for seven runs in 2 2-3 innings of a 10-1 defeat.Though the rookie right-hander has a 1.93 ERA while winning his last two home starts, he hopes to rebound after he gave up five runs in 6 1-3 innings of a 6-4 loss at Toronto last Wednesday.Roberts\' one hit in three at-bats against Gonzalez left the park. He hopes to face Gonzalez again despite leaving Tuesday\'s contest with a strained left forearm.""If it\'s up to me, I\'m playing,"" said Roberts, who is 2 for 14 with two home runs versus Baltimore in 2012. ""I definitely want to play even if it\'s going to hurt a little bit.\'\' ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

And it nearly did, when the Tampa Bay Rays put two men on base in the top of the 14th.But this is 2012, and the Rays did not score. Instead it was the Orioles who did, in the bottom of the inning, adding one more moment of pure jubilation to a season that becomes more remarkable by the batter.To get the final out in the top of the 14th, Manager Buck Showalter turned to one of his crew of castoffs, the left-hander Randy Wolf, who got an inning-ending strikeout. And then, with two outs in the bottom of the 14th, Adam Jones walked, the much-traveled Endy Chavez singled, and the rookie third baseman Manny Machado hit a soft liner that left fielder Matt Joyce dived for but trapped.Just like that, the Orioles had another one-run victory \xe2\x80\x94 their 27th in 34 games decided by that margin \xe2\x80\x94 with this one taking five and a half hours before an extremely appreciative crowd. And the scene at the end was the same as it was the night before, when another castoff, outfielder Nate McLouth, stroked the game-winning hit off the right-field wall in another 3-2 victory over the Rays.

Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s win gave Baltimore a 13-2 record in extra-inning games; it also guaranteed that the Orioles will finish with at least a .500 record for the first time since 1997, which happens to be the last time they made it to the postseason.Over the last week, the Orioles played seven straight games at Camden Yards against the Yankees and the Rays and won five of them. As they showered and dressed to head to Oakland for a three-game weekend series, they had first place all to themselves, until the Yankees beat the Boston Red Sox, 2-0, on Thursday night to stay tied with Baltimore.For a group that has never been through a pennant race before, these Orioles weathered the past week\xe2\x80\x99s test just fine. But now comes an Athletics team as surprisingly tough as the Orioles have been, followed by series in Seattle and Boston. Over all, 19 games remain, and the Orioles know that if they fail to win the division, they need to at least capture one of the two wild-card berths to validate their season.

When Manager Joe Girardi declared recently that the Yankees were not the Bronx Bunters, it was more than a snappy line. It was something to relish.The last time the Yankees won the World Series, in 2009, they set a franchise record for home runs, with 244, and led the majors in that category. This year\xe2\x80\x99s team also leads the majors, and was on pace to hit 243 home runs before facing the Boston Red Sox on Thursday. These Yankees are the first team in baseball history to homer in at least 116 of the first 142 games of a season.They did not homer on Thursday, when Phil Hughes and the bullpen stifled a thin Boston lineup in a 2-0 victory at Fenway Park. The Yankees managed only four singles and a double and used small-ball hallmarks like the stolen base and the sacrifice fly. Those are useful when the situation calls for them, but the home run is always a good play.\xe2\x80\x9cI feel like in baseball, no matter what, there\xe2\x80\x99s always something you or a team can\xe2\x80\x99t do \xe2\x80\x94 even the best players and the best teams didn\xe2\x80\x99t do something,\xe2\x80\x9d said Curtis Granderson, who has 37 homers and batted seventh for the Yankees on Thursday. \xe2\x80\x9cRight now, the word on us is that we score a lot of runs with home runs. I don\xe2\x80\x99t know; there could be a lot worse things to talk about with us.\xe2\x80\x9d Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      Granderson is not having a great season. He strikes out too much and came into Thursday\xe2\x80\x99s game hitting .235. But he is an elite power hitter, whether he acknowledges it or not, and players like that can take over games.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  On Sunday, Granderson homered and drove in five runs to beat Baltimore. On Wednesday, he drilled a two-run homer and a solo shot in a 5-4 victory at Fenway Park. The Yankees also slugged their way to their other runs, with a two-run homer by Robinson Cano.According to the Elias Sports Bureau, it was the first time the Yankees had won despite going 0 for 13 with runners in scoring position since May 31, 1961, when Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris went deep in another one-run game at Fenway. Futility in the clutch is a bad strategy, of course, but home runs can make up for almost anything. Photo       Alex Rodriguez (13) and Robinson Cano after Cano\xe2\x80\x99s two-run homer Wednesday. The Yankees lead the majors in home runs.  Credit             CJ Gunther/European Pressphoto Agency           Ask Billy Beane, the Oakland general manager, why the A\xe2\x80\x99s are winning this year, and one reason, he will say, is a lineup loaded with home run threats.

In the last World Series, the St. Louis Cardinals won games by scores of 16-7 and 10-9. The year before, the San Francisco Giants won games by scores of 11-7 and 9-0.

They\xe2\x80\x99ve still got to throw it over the plate, and if they make a mistake and your guys have power, you\xe2\x80\x99ve still got that chance of changing the game.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees led the majors in homers last season, too, and lost in the first round to the Detroit Tigers, who hit one more homer than the Yankees did in the fifth and deciding game. The Texas Rangers, who finished second in the majors in homers, took the A.L. pennant.Since 2004, when steroid testing with penalties began, every World Series team but one (the 2005 Houston Astros) has hit more home runs than the league average total.

''So I did a pump-fake and tried to deke the runner. It was just natural. I just came out and didn't think about it.''What made the play even more impressive is that Machado is a converted shortstop.

Only nine times in modern baseball history has a team trailed in its division by 10 games or more on July 18 and come back to win the title, with the 1995 Seattle Mariners being the last club to do so (while winning a one-game playoff with the California Angels). The Orioles trailed the Yankees by 10 games on July 18 (and were a half game up on Tampa Bay Rays). But the Orioles and Rays won\'t claim the AL East record for such a comeback. The 1978 Yankees were 14 games behind the Boston Red Sox on July 18 of that year and eventually won a legendary playoff to capture the division flag (thanks to light hitting Bucky Dent\'s homer). var adSkipCounter = 0;  Three teams \xe2\x80\x94 the 1951 New York Giants, the 1978 Yankees and 1995 Mariners \xe2\x80\x94 tied for the division and had to win a one-game playoff to join the list. The St. Louis Cardinals franchise has done it three different times in its history. According to Arnold, the list of teams to accomplish the feat were: The 1914 Boston Braves, the 1930 Cardinals, the 1942 Cardinals, the 1951 New York Giants, 1964 Cardinals, 1969 New York Mets, 1978 Yankees, 1993 Atlanta Braves and 1995 Mariners.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Instead, this three-game set has wide-ranging ramifications.The Athletics\' 56-26 record since June 11 is baseball\'s best, and the numbers in that stretch - 118 homers and a 3.21 ERA, both second in the majors - offer plenty of evidence for why they\'ve been so effective.Baltimore\'s rise is harder to quantify. The Orioles have a negative-20 run differential, but they\'ve been nearly unbeatable in close games. They wrapped up a three-game sweep of fellow contender Tampa Bay on Thursday with a 3-2 victory in 14 innings, improving to 27-7 in one-run games with their 13th straight extra-inning win.That guaranteed Baltimore would finish with at least a .500 record, but considering it\'s tied with the Yankees atop the East, that\'s not the end game for manager Buck Showalter\'s club.""There\'s a bigger goal in mind,\'\' Showalter said. ""That wasn\'t the goal from Day One this spring. Really, Day One of the offseason. It\'s watching other teams for years and saying, \'We want to do what they\'re doing. We\'d like to get a chair at the dance, you know?\'""Oakland is also currently sitting in one as the top wild card and lurking three games behind West-leading Texas. It was denied a sweep of Anaheim with a 6-0 loss Thursday, but after winning the previous three games, is 4 1/2 games up on the Angels - currently third in the wild-card chase - to make the postseason cut.Friday marks the start of Oakland\'s lone home series in a 20-game stretch. After this weekend, the A\'s play three in Detroit, three in New York and four at Texas.""It doesn\'t get any easier, but I don\'t think there are any easy teams in the American League, to tell the truth,\'\' manager Bob Melvin said. ""At times, you\'ll catch teams when they\'re down, but everybody we play from now until the end of the year we\'ll consider basically the same type of challenge and we\'ll have to play well to win.\'\'Oakland and Baltimore split six previous meetings - all at Camden Yards - and neither of Friday\'s starters were involved. The Orioles\' Joe Saunders (2-1, 4.24 ERA) was with Arizona during those previous contests, but he\'ll be looking for a third straight win in the opener.Saunders had a rocky debut with Baltimore on Aug. 29 but tossed 6 1-3 scoreless innings at Toronto on Sept. 3, then held the Yankees to two runs over 5 1-3 in Saturday\'s 5-4 victory.The left-hander held Oakland to two runs over six innings in a 4-3 win for the Diamondbacks on June 10, improving to 4-0 with a 1.16 ERA in his last four starts against the A\'s.Oakland center fielder Yoenis Cespedes missed that game with an injury, and Saunders may avoid him again. Cespedes left Thursday\'s game with a sprained left wrist and is day to day.The A\'s hand the ball to Tommy Milone (12-10, 3.90), who has never faced Baltimore. Milone tied a career high with 10 strikeouts while holding Seattle to two runs over six innings in a 4-2 road win Sunday.The left-hander, whose home ERA was 0.91 through eight starts, has a 6.75 ERA in Oakland over his last five.With his next victory, Milone will break the Oakland record for wins by a rookie that was set by Chris Codiroli in 1983 and equaled by Joe Blanton in 2005.

But alas, it wasn\'t meant to be as the Orioles tonight were out-Orioled by the Oakland Athletics, and lost just their 8th one-run game on the year. It was lefty vs. lefty tonight, with Joe Saunders pitching for the O\'s and Tommy Milone for the A\'s. Malone has been better than Saunders on the season, but in the ballpark that is the Oakland Coliseum, a lot of things even out. Even so, Saunders just wasn\'t quite good enough tonight. Of course, you don\'t win many games with just two runs. Each pitcher allowed one baserunner through the first two innings, a first-inning double by Adam Jones for the O\'s and a second-inning single by Josh Donaldson for the A\'s. But in the third inning, the Orioles caught a break that allowed them to get on the scoreboard first. Manny Machado led off the inning with a single up the middle and moved up two bases on two fly balls. That\'s how ridiculous the outfield in Oakland is. People are tagging up from first to second. J.J. Hardy hit a ground ball to the third baseman Donaldson, who couldn\'t play the hop and the ball bounced away from him. Shortstop Stephen Drew grabbed the ball on the carom and fired to first base, too late to get Hardy. Machado came in to score and the O\'s were up 1-0. That lead held for about an inning, as Saunders gave up a two-run homer to Yoenis Cespedes in the bottom of the fourth inning. And let me tell you, have watching well hit fly ball after well hit fly ball land in front of the warning track tonight, I\'m impressed that Cespedes has 19 on the year. I\'d go over to Baseball-Reference.com to check out his home/road splits, but it\'s one in the morning so forgive me for not caring.    Chris Davis led off the fifth inning and it was as though he said, ""Really, Yoenis? Left field? That\'s child\'s play."" Chris hit a deep fly ball to straightaway center that just got out of the ballpark. I don\'t really understand why 400 feet in Oakland looks so much bigger than 400 feet in Baltimore. Maybe it\'s the time zone. Anyway, the homer tied the game at 2 runs apiece.    The A\'s took the lead in the bottom of the inning, thanks in part to rare bad defense by third baseman Manny Machado. If you look at the box score for tonight\'s game, you\'ll see that Adam Rosales hit a double. What it really was was a ball that Machado didn\'t make the play on, a ball that he\'d normally get to easily. The next batter, Coco Crisp, hit a solid single to left field, moving Rosales up to third base. He\'d come in to score on a cheap ground ball single by Jonny Gomes that just got past Hardy at shortstop. Saunders caught a break with the next batter, Josh Reddick (who I always want to call J.J.). Reddick smoked a line drive to right that Reynolds caught and easily doubled off Gomes at first base for the second out of the inning. The Orioles elected to intentionally walk Cespedes, a move that worked out when the next batter, Chris Carter, grounded out to end the inning.    The most frustrating thing about the Orioles offense tonight was not necessarily that that they scored only two runs. Don\'t get me wrong, only scoring two runs sucks. But sometimes a team just gets plain shut down, and it\'s hard to argue with that. But that\'s not what happened tonight. They had their chances, but instead of capitalizing on them, they hit into double plays. They hit into double plays in the fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh innings. The box score shows that they left four runners on base tonight, but that\'s because so many of them were wiped out on the basepaths. A pleasant surprise in tonight\'s game was Jake Arrieta, who came on to pitch in relief in the seventh inning. He pitched both the seventh and eighth and faced just six batters, striking out five. The sixth, Reddick, singled to lead off the eighth, but was called out on a strange batter interference call. Arrieta struck out Cespedes swinging as Reddick took off for second base, and Cespedes stepped forward onto the plate, blocking Matt Wieters so that he couldn\'t throw. It was a good call, but one I\'ve never seen before. But kudos to Arrieta for such a fine performance. Unfortunately, as Arrieta was holding the A\'s, the O\'s weren\'t able to score again. Former Oriole farmhand Pat Neshek, who was given to the A\'s for practically nothing earlier this season, combined with Ryan Cook to keep the Orioles off the board for closer Grant Balfour in the ninth. Wieters started the inning with a ground ball ball deep in the hole at shortstop, and beat it out! Infield hit for Wieters! He was of course immediately replaced by a pinch runner, Xavier Avery. With a righty pitcher on the mound, Buck Showalter decided to pinch hit for Lew Ford with...Endy Chavez? We discovered after the game that Wilson Betemit has a sore wrist, but is there really no one on the bench that was a better option than Endy? Endy struck out. You\'re shocked, I know. Mark Reynolds tried to put the O\'s ahead with a monster swing, but he got under the ball and instead flew out to left field. So with two outs, it was all up to Chris Davis. I know Davis isn\'t the most reliable guy on the team, but when you need a homer to get ahead in the ninth inning, he\'s a pretty good guy to have at the plate. Chris had the count at 1-2 when Balfour threw him another ball. I was thinking, ""OK, Chris, you\'re still alive!"" when the A\'s catcher threw down to second base because Avery was stealing! WHAT?! And he wasn\'t successful! Game over. My goodness.  ', 'www.camdenchat.com')]"

09/17/2012,"[(""Orioles 9, A's 5 - Yahoo"", 'OAKLAND -- The Orioles needed something different on Sunday if they were ever going to figure out how to win in Oakland.  It turns out all they needed was to play in daylight.  Baltimore continued its mastery of day baseball, winning for an American League-leading 28th time in 42 chances, to stave off a three-game sweep at the hand of the A\'s, who as hosts had beaten the Birds 16 of their previous 18 games dating back to 2008.  Catcher Matt Wieters led the Orioles\' 9-5 victory by hitting a pair of home runs and reaching base four times in all. Oakland\'s pitchers were more than generous in allowing nine walks. The Orioles moved to within two games of the A\'s lead in the wild card standings with their 27th win in 40 games.  The Orioles broke it open in the seventh with a three-run rally. Wieters and Mark Reynolds drew walks to open the frame before rookie third baseman Manny Machado doubled to left-center to plate the first run. Endy Chavez\'s single to center against a drawn-in infield scored two more against Tyson Ross, Oakland\'s fifth pitcher in three innings. Chavez went 4-for-4 with a walk and scored twice.  The long ball accounted for most of the scoring early.  A\'s right fielder Josh Reddick found his stroke again to belt a 2-0 pitch into the right field seats with a runner on in the first inning. Reddick\'s 29th homer came after having gone just 8-for-55 (.145) with three RBIs over 14 games. Collin Cowgill led off the game with a double two batters earlier.  Wieters cut the early deficit in half with the first of his two homers, a deep drive to right on a 2-2 count with one out in the second inning. A\'s starter and loser Dan Straily (2-1) had retired the first four Orioles he faced.  The visitors continued to chip away one run at a time. J.J. Hardy\'s smash to third ricocheted off of Josh Donaldson and into foul territory to allow Chavez to score with two outs in the third. Hardy was awarded an infield single.  Wieters launched the first pitch of the fourth again into the right field seats off of Straily to break the 2-2 tie. And Straily lost command an inning later when his third walk of the fifth inning forced in Baltimore\'s fourth run. Known for his outstanding strikeout-to-walk ratio, Straily was removed after walking five and fanning just one.  The A\'s season-long struggles with the strikeout continued on Sunday. When Stephen Drew went down swinging to lead off the sixth against Orioles reliever Brian Matusz (6-10), it marked a franchise record for A\'s batters striking out. Their 1,231 strikeouts top the previous team record of 1,226 set in 2008.  Left-hander Randy Wolf made his first start for the Orioles after working in relief during his first three outings with Baltimore.

But it\xe2\x80\x99s the way he does it that leaves you shaking your head. His swing, especially from the left side, is absolutely beautiful. I mean it\xe2\x80\x99s BEAUTIFUL -- it\xe2\x80\x99s Griffey beautiful, Strawberry beautiful, Billy Williams beautiful, Will Clark beautiful.

Manager Buck Showalter knew from the start that Tillman was struggling -- a dip in his normal velocity led to walks in the first two innings, and a two-out, two-run homer by Chris Dickerson in the second. ""He has been so consistent with his velocity early in the game, and you could tell early on that he was really laboring,"" Showalter said. ""I talked to him after the third inning and didn\'t like what I was seeing. ... Hopefully, it was just a onetime thing."" Tillman has dominated the Mariners twice this season, most recently tossing 7 1/3 innings of one-run ball on Aug. 6.

They are also 5-12 in all games decided by seven or more runs, helping explain their negative run differential on the season.     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

(AP Photo/Ted S. Warren)MoreSEATTLE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 Those involved in continuing Baltimore\'s late-season surge \xe2\x80\x94 whether it\'s taking nine, 11 or 18 innings to get the victories \xe2\x80\x94 continue to marvel at what the Orioles are accomplishing and the ways they are getting it done.The Orioles are hanging around the AL East race, surging to the top of the wild-card chase and winning at all hours of the day, night and early morning.""It\'s crazy. I thought we were going to play another 15 or 16 tonight. We were doing dancing in there, stuff like that,"" Baltimore starter Joe Saunders said. ""It gets to the point where you get comfortable in those situations.""Adam Jones hit a two-run homer in the top of the 11th inning and the Orioles won their 15th straight extra-innings game with a 3-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday night.A night after the teams played an 18-inning marathon that lasted nearly 6 hours, Jones, the one-time Mariners prospect, gave Baltimore a huge boost in its race with the Yankees for the lead in the AL East. Even with New York sweeping a doubleheader from Toronto on Wednesday, the Orioles stayed just a half-game back in the division race. Additionally, the Orioles moved into the top spot in the AL wild-card race after Oakland was handed a 6-2 loss in Detroit.According to the Orioles, with information from the Elias Sports Bureau, the 15 straight extra-inning wins is the longest streak since the Cleveland Indians won 17 straight in 1949. Throw in a sweep of Seattle and wins in seven of nine and the Orioles are making plenty of September noise.""We need the wins. It doesn\'t matter who or how, we just need the wins,"" Jones said.Jones\' turned on a 3-2 pitch from Seattle\'s Josh Kinney (0-3) and sent his 30th homer into the Baltimore bullpen in left field to finally break a 1-1 tie that had lasted since the fourth inning. Jones became the first Baltimore outfielder to reach 30 homers since Brady Anderson hit 50 in 1996. It was his third career homer against the franchise that drafted the talented center fielder, and then traded him to the Orioles as part of a massive deal that brought pitcher Erik Bedard to Seattle.Jim Johnson pitched the bottom of the 11th for his major league-leading 45th save. It wasn\'t a basic save, though, as Kyle Seager and Jesus Montero started the inning with singles. Johnson quickly rebounded to get Justin Smoak to ground into a 3-6-1 double play.Michael Saunders walked, but was caught stealing by Taylor Teagarden trying to get into scoring position while pinch-hitter John Jaso never got the bat off his shoulder for the final out.""I thought they were going to take their chances with Jaso hitting and when he took off I was a little surprised, but I got a good pitch to throw on and it got there in time,"" said Teagarden, whose RBI single in the 18th inning the night before proved to be the winning run.Saunders didn\'t second-guess his decision to try and get into scoring position.""I had to be aggressive in that situation and I had to get to second base,"" he said.Baltimore was only able to reach the 11th thanks to Luis Ayala\'s pitching in the bottom of the 10th. Seattle loaded the bases with two outs thanks to walks to Saunders, Trayvon Robinson and Dustin Ackley. Ayala (5-4) was brought in to face Franklin Gutierrez, who hit his fourth homer of the season in the fourth inning to account for Seattle\'s only run. Gutierrez was able to work the count to 3-2, but Ayala came inside and forced a weak pop up to shortstop to end Seattle\'s best scoring threat.Lost in the extra inning drama were the performances of starters Joe Saunders and Felix Hernandez on a night both teams needed a break for their bullpens.Saunders was the perfect option for the Orioles to have on the mound considering his past success against the Mariners in Seattle. In his previous six starts at Safeco Field, Saunders was 6-0 with a 0.98 ERA. It was just the recipe Baltimore needed with a taxed bullpen that saw seven relievers work in Tuesday night\'s game.Saunders did his part getting through eight innings. He gave up five hits and struck out two. It was just the second time this season \xe2\x80\x94 and first since joining the Orioles in August \xe2\x80\x94 that Saunders pitched at least eight innings. He had a complete game three-hitter for Arizona against Miami in April.""You can talk a lot about what happened this game, offensively and what not, but the conversation has to start with the effort that Joe gave us,"" Orioles manager Buck Showalter said.Hernandez gave up just one run, six hits and struck out eight. The lone run off Seattle\'s ace was due to hustle. Chris Davis was running on a 3-2 pitch and scored from first on Mark Reynolds\' single in the fourth inning, sliding across home plate ahead of Jesus Montero\'s sweep tag.Notes: Baltimore swept the Mariners in Seattle for the first time since 1997. ... Baltimore prospect Dylan Bundy was recalled from Double-A Bowie on Wednesday. The Orioles needed the extra arm in the bullpen after Tuesday\'s 18-inning marathon and the 19-year-old was the choice. ... Tuesday\'s game was the second-longest in Safeco Field history by innings and the longest by time at 5 hours, 44 minutes. ... Baltimore LHP Brian Matusz pitched in the 10th inning less than 24 hours after needing to go to a Seattle hospital seeking treatment for an allergic food reaction. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles 3, Mariners 1: Sweep! - Camden Chat', ' Today, Jeff Sullivan of Fangraphs said, ""2012 will probably forever be known as the year of the WTF Orioles."" The WTF Orioles won another close game tonight, in extra innings no less, which probably inspire such sentiments. The bewilderment expressed by the WTFers can be answered simply - the Orioles executed and the Mariners did not. This does not mean there weren\'t head scratcher moments. For example, two in-game situations come to mind when identifying vulnerable moments for the Orioles. Ultimately though, the team executed the right plays while the Mariners did not. 1) Tonight\'s match up between Felix Hernandez and Joe Saunders didn\'t look favorable to the Orioles. While Hernandez had struggled the last few starts, I think it\'s fair to say he\'s the better pitcher than Saunders, and if given the choice, I would take Hernandez over Saunders. But tonight, Saunders got the job done. Hernandez probably pitched the better game as he struck out 4 times as many batters (eight to Saunders\' two), but both pitchers only gave up one run over eight innings. In the end, Saunders put more balls in-play but many of the balls ended up at players and the fielders executed the plays. Obviously there is a certain degree of luck on balls in play, but the O\'s defense executed the plays that were within their control and deserve credit for that. I think Saunders did keep the M\'s a bit off balance by successfully locating his beastly 88 mph fastball to the corners of the plate. As a result, he managed to keep the ball inside the park and possibly helped induce fieldable balls. The exception came in the fourth inning when he grooved a fastball to Franklin Gutierrez, who drilled it over the fence. Safeco and the inepittude of the Mariners\' offense certainly helped Saunders but he managed to go toe-to-toe with Hernandez. Springfield represent! 2) In the bottom of the 10th inning, Pedro Strop continued to foster more apprehension and distrust with another shaky outing. He started the inning by walking Michael Saunders before retiring Miguel Olivio and walking Trayvon Robinson. Out goes Strop, in comes Brian Matusz. Matusz strikes out Mike Carp and walks Dustin Ackley. With two outs, bases loaded in the bottom of the tenth inning, the situation looked worrisome for the Orioles. To make matters worse, Luis Ayala, who has struggled to strand runners all season, was brought in to face this mess. But Ayala executed by inducing a pop out to Franklin Gutierrez and the game went to the 11th inning.\r In contrast, the Mariners\' bullpen was not able to execute the right pitches and it costed them the game. In the top of the 11th inning, Josh Kinney gave up a single to Nate McLouth followed by a home run by Adam Jones. Keeping the ball inside the park is completely within the control of the pitcher and Kinney did not get it done. In the bottom of the 11th inning, Jim Johnson came out for the save and immediately ran into trouble by giving up singles to Kyle Seager and Jesus Montero. But the Orioles executed a double play which included a great catch by Jim Johnson who was covering 1B. Jim Johnson then gave up a walk to Michael Saunders who tried to steal second base, but Taylor Teagarden gunned him down. Ball game over and the O\'s moved to 15-2 in extra inning games. Broadly speaking, I do agree with the notion that winning extra inning games is not really a discernible team skill. A strong bullpen certainly helps a team\'s ability to win extra inning games but I don\'t think that should be conflated as a skill in winning them. When analyzing only a handful of plays which usually constitute an extra innings game, a team\'s fate can shift on capricious and temperamental events like a ground ball that takes a bad hop to a fielder or a blown call. But tonight\'s game wasn\'t really about bad hops or close blown calls. The O\'s won through clutch hitting (thank you Adam Jones), excellent relief pitching (except for you Pedro. Go sit in the corner), and flawless execution on the defense. And for those who still scratch their head over how the O\'s are kicking ass, at least for tonight, your answer is right there.

Regardless of the venue of these series, that familiar \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Go Red Sox\xe2\x80\x9d chant would always be prevalent, as the Boston fans would come down to Camden Yards for the weekend if the series was in Baltimore. We\xe2\x80\x99ll touch more on that aspect perhaps next weekend (in what could truly be a historic weekend in Baltimore), however the fact is that this weekend\xe2\x80\x99s series with Boston will have those aspects. One team is in fact fighting for the playoffs, and the other preparing to go home. We will probably hear those \xe2\x80\x9cLet\xe2\x80\x99s Go Red Sox\xe2\x80\x9d chants, as the games will be at Fenway. However the shoe\xe2\x80\x99s most certainly on the other foot\xe2\x80\xa6I think that for a long time the Boston Red Sox would probably smile when they\xe2\x80\x99d see the Orioles on their September schedule because they assumed that they could pick up some easy wins on their way to the post season. While it\xe2\x80\x99s now the O\xe2\x80\x99s who are chasing October and looking to go onto the \xe2\x80\x9cpromised land,\xe2\x80\x9d I somehow don\xe2\x80\x99t think that they\xe2\x80\x99re taking Boston as lightly as they would probably have taken the Orioles over the years. I\xe2\x80\x99m not even necessarily blaming Boston if in fact they ever took the Orioles lightly, because the Orioles had some pretty light years. I\xe2\x80\x99m reminded of the game on September 1, 2007 at Fenway when the Orioles lost 10-0 to Boston. Clay Buchholz also no-hit the Orioles that night, adding to the Birds\xe2\x80\x99 growing list of instances in which they got to sit in the opposing dugout and watch Boston celebrate at their expense.Courtesy of Steven Bisig-US PRESSWIREThat game was the same season in which the Orioles blew a 5-1 lead at Fenway in the last of the ninth inning to lose 6-5, in a game that\xe2\x80\x99s known to Orioles fans as the \xe2\x80\x9cMother\xe2\x80\x99s Day Massacre.\xe2\x80\x9d So needless to say, the O\xe2\x80\x99s have provided the Fenway Faithful with their share of memories, and in fact they probably helped add to the perception of arrogance that has at times come from the Boston club house. (When you beat someone\xe2\x80\x99s brains in so many times, why shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t you look down on them?)\xc2\xa0However ask yourself if either of those games would have gone as they did given this year\xe2\x80\x99s Orioles team. Manager Sam Perlozzo removed starter Jeremy Guthrie after a masterful performance with once out in the 9th. The reason?\xe2\x80\xa6catcher Ramon Hernandez dropped a routine pop up. In that September 1st game, the last couple of innings were a flurry of Orioles swinging and missing as they tried desperately to get on base. Would a Buck Showalter-coached team continue to do that, or would they work the count a bit more?That\xe2\x80\x99s the difference in these Orioles as opposed to those Orioles, and that\xe2\x80\x99s why they go into Fenway with massive playoff hopes this weekend.

The Orioles won 9-6. (AP Photo/Michael Dwyer)MoreBOSTON (AP) -- When a game goes into extra innings, the Baltimore Orioles have been almost unbeatable. When Jim Thome comes up in a big situation, his teammates are confident he'll deliver.Thome did that Saturday, doubling in the go-ahead run in a 9-6 win in 12 innings over the Boston Red Sox that was Baltimore's 16th straight victory in games that reach overtime.The 22-year veteran came through in his first game after nearly two months on the disabled list, enabling the Orioles to remain one game behind the first-place New York Yankees in the AL East. They lead the Oakland Athletics by two games for the league's No. 1 wild-card berth.''This situation is not new to him,'' said Adam Jones, who doubled and scored on Thome's hit. ''He's missed some time, but stepping into that box ... he always rises to the occasion.''Just as the Orioles rise to the challenge of extra-inning games. Their winning streak in those games is the best in the majors since the Cleveland Indians won 17 straight in 1949. The Orioles are 16-2 in extras this year, losing only to the Yankees on April 10-11.''We've had so much experience at it there's not some sense of panic,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.The Orioles won their sixth in a row overall.Thome had two homers, six RBIs and 10 walks in 18 games after being acquired from Philadelphia on July 1 before going on the disabled list from July 31 until Friday with a herniated disc in his neck.''These guys have been playing very well and to come in and get a big hit like that is big,'' he said. ''You want to be a part of what they're doing and I think that's what makes you work hard when you're down (in the minors) because you really don't know when you're on rehab how the process is going to go. So being here and being in this atmosphere, you enjoy every minute of it.''Thome was having a rough day in his first appearance since July 27, and was 0 for 5 with a double play and two strikeouts. But the slugger gave Baltimore a 7-6 lead with his ground-rule double off Alfredo Aceves (2-10). Endy Chavez and Manny Machado added RBI singles to pad the lead.''The game is a weird game. That's what makes it so fun,'' Thome said. ''You can be 0 for 5 and continue to be positive and keep battling and you get a big hit like that.''Tommy Hunter (6-8) pitched a perfect 11th and Jim Johnson finished to extend his franchise record to 47 saves. He's blown just three.Jones earlier hit his 31st home run.The Red Sox are 0-7 in extra-inning games at home.''At the end of the season, the teams that you see go into the playoffs pull out the extra-inning games,'' Boston's Cody Ross said. ''We just haven't been able to do that this year.''Their lineup Saturday had seven players, including starter Aaron Cook, who spent time in the minors this year.''When you don't have the firepower for the big hit,'' Boston manager Bobby Valentine said, ''the guys came up short.''Trailing 6-3, the Red Sox tied the game with two runs in the seventh and one in the eighth.In the seventh, they loaded the bases with no outs against Jake Arrieta on a double by Scott Podsednik, a walk to Pedro Ciriaco and an infield single by Dustin Pedroia. Ross and Ryan Lavarnway each drove in a run when they grounded into forceouts.Pedro Strop relieved to start the bottom of the eighth and retired the first two batters. But Daniel Nava and Podsednik followed with consecutive doubles, tying it at 6.The Orioles took a 1-0 lead in the first when Nate McLouth led off with a walk, stole second, moved up on a groundout and scored on a grounder by Jones. The Red Sox tied it in the bottom half on a ground-rule double by Pedroia and a single by Lavarnway.Baltimore made it 2-1 in the second on an RBI single by Machado then added a run in the fourth on a leadoff homer by Mark Reynolds, his 22nd of the year.Boston tied it in the bottom half of the fourth on a leadoff single by Mike Aviles and Danny Valencia's first homer since the Red Sox acquired him from the Minnesota Twins on Aug. 5. It was his third of the season.The Orioles went back on top 5-3 in the sixth on a two-run triple by Ryan Flaherty, starting for second baseman Robert Andino, who was in uniform but didn't play after being hit on the left ear flap of his helmet by a pitch in the ninth inning of Baltimore's 4-2 win on Friday night. Results of a CAT scan were negative and Showalter said that, pending results of other tests, he might play Sunday.Jones made it 6-3 in the seventh with his homer.''I'm tired of playing extra-inning games, to be honest with you,'' Jones said, ''but, hey, we're not quitting 'til that last out is made, and if we need 13, 14 15, up to 18 innings to do the job, then I guess that's just what we have to do.''NOTES: Three of the Orioles last four games have gone extra innings, wins at Seattle of 4-2 in 18 innings and 3-1 in 11 before opening the series in Boston. .... The three Red Sox in the lineup who haven't been in the minors this year were Aviles, Pedroia and Ross. ... Cook had won his previous start after going 0-5 in six before that. ... Cook had allowed just one stolen base, the fewest among AL pitchers with at least 80 innings, before McLouth stole second in the first. ... Chris Tillman (8-2) pitches for Baltimore against Felix Doubront (11-9) in Sunday's finale of the three-game series. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"

In 1927, the year Babe Ruth hit 60 home runs, they won the A.L. pennant by 19 games. In 1936, when Joe DiMaggio was a rookie and Lou Gehrig was Lou Gehrig, they won by 19 1/2 games. In 1998, on the way to sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series for a record overall total of 125 victories, they won the division by 22 games.But now, as the Yankees duel the Baltimore Orioles, if not also the Tampa Bay Rays, for the A.L. East title after opening a 10-game lead July 18, a scary statistic haunts them, and should motivate them. When leading the league or the division by seven or more games during a season, the Yankees always finished first.There\xe2\x80\x99s time for the Yankees to pull away (or fade away and lose even a wild-card berth) before their three-game finale against the Boston Red Sox at the Stadium early next week. As they headed toward Monday night\xe2\x80\x99s opener of a three-game series in Minnesota, followed by a four-game visit to Toronto, they were 88-64, a game ahead of the Orioles. Continue reading the main story        Advertisement  Continue reading the main story      But recent September history provides another worrisome statistic. In their three close divisional races over the previous seven seasons, the Yankees twice finished second: two games behind the Red Sox in 2007 with the wild card assured, and one behind the Rays in 2010 with the wild card assured. In 2005, the Yankees finished first on a tiebreaker with the Red Sox after they posted 95-67 records.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In between, the Yankees won the East by eight games in 2009 en route to their 27th World Series victory. But over more than a century, in 14 seasons when two or fewer games separated the Yankees from winning or losing a pennant in the final standings, they were the victors only five times.Of their four pennant triumphs by one game, the most theatrical developed in 1978 after the Yankees, once 14 games behind, and the Red Sox each finished with a 99-63 record. In a one-game playoff at Fenway Park, the Yankees won, 5-4, on Bucky Dent\xe2\x80\x99s three-run homer, Reggie Jackson\xe2\x80\x99s home run and Goose Gossage\xe2\x80\x99s relief pitching. The Yankees went on to win the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.On the final weekend in 1949, the Yankees swept a two-game series at the Stadium to edge the Red Sox by a game. In the World Series they defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers for the first of a record five consecutive titles under Manager Casey Stengel.

Privacy Policy    In 1964, with Yogi Berra a rookie manager, they clinched a fifth straight A.L. pennant on the final Sunday in Cleveland; Mickey Mantle hit 35 homers and drove in 111 runs, and Whitey Ford had a 17-6 record with a 2.13 earned run average. When the Yankees lost the World Series to the St. Louis Cardinals, Berra was fired, to be replaced by Johnny Keane, who had managed the Cardinals to the National League pennant.

The Yankees lost the World Series to the New York Giants in four games (and a 3-3 tie halted by darkness).  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In 1952, the Cleveland Indians had the 20-game winners Early Wynn (23-12), Bob Lemon and Mike Garcia (each 22-11), but the Yankees prevailed by two games as Mantle, replacing DiMaggio in center field, hit .311 with 23 home runs. Allie Reynolds was 20-8 with a league-leading 2.06 E.R.A. The Yankees again defeated the Dodgers in the Series.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  In its second season, 1904, the New York team then known as the Highlanders had an opportunity to snatch the pennant from the Boston team known then as the Americans by winning a final-day doubleheader at old Hilltop Park in northern Manhattan. But the Highlanders lost the first game on the 41-game winner Jack Chesbro\xe2\x80\x99s ninth-inning wild pitch and finished one and a half games out.Five times the Yankees finished second by two games: in 2007 to the Red Sox (who went on to win their second World Series in four seasons), in 1997 and 1974 to the Orioles, in 1985 to the Toronto Blue Jays, and in 1924 to the Washington Senators, whose Walter Johnson was 23-7 with a 2.72 E.R.A. The Yankees also finished third by two games in a three-way race in 1940, when the Detroit Tigers nipped the Indians by a game.So history tells us that when a pennant race boiled down to the final weekend, past Yankees teams won and lost. But as the days and nights dwindle down this September, this Yankees team, like each of the others, will create its own legacy. For better or for worse.   Correction: September 27, 2012   A Sports of The Times column on Monday, about the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 history in close playoff races, misstated the number of games the Yankees were behind the Red Sox at one point in 1978, when the Yankees rallied to tie the Red Sox and won a one-game playoff. It was 14 games, not 14 \xc2\xbd.     A version of this article appears in print on September 24, 2012, on Page D7 of the New York edition with the headline: Yankees Not the Best In Tight Races.

The Yankees, for the third time this series, had an opportunity to win with a hit. But the Oakland Athletics held on for a 5-4 win Sunday.The loss ended the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 seven-game winning streak, but the mood in the postgame clubhouse remained celebrative. The team finished the homestand 7-2 and seemed to have righted its play without once dipping below the Baltimore Orioles in the American League East.Baltimore, trailing by one game, also lost Sunday, to the Boston Red Sox.\xe2\x80\x9cWe\xe2\x80\x99d love for everybody behind us to lose every day, but we don\xe2\x80\x99t need that to happen,\xe2\x80\x9d Derek Jeter said. \xe2\x80\x9cWe control what happens.

Credit             Barton Silverman/The New York Times           There was also understandable fatigue, and both teams\xe2\x80\x99 pitching staffs were left thin. Yankees long relievers Derek Lowe and Freddy Garcia were inactive after making lengthy appearances, and only Rafael Soriano, David Robertson, Adam Warren (a starter) and Phelps were held out of Saturday\xe2\x80\x99s game, as far as relievers go. That left it up to starter Hiroki Kuroda to give the Yankees some innings.

He started off shaky, needing 24 pitches to get out of the first, then he fell behind by 3-0 after a two-run homer by Cliff Pennington in the third. His slider did not have its usual effectiveness, and his overall command was uncharacteristically off. He walked more than two batters for the first time since June 19.\xe2\x80\x9cI was trying to hit those corners, and I got behind in the count,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuroda said through Nimura.He also threw two wild pitches and allowed seven hits and five runs (four earned) before being relieved with two outs in the sixth. On a day when the Yankees really needed him to last, Kuroda failed to finish six innings for the first time since July 6.\xe2\x80\x9cBecause of the game yesterday, I wanted to go longer in the game,\xe2\x80\x9d Kuroda said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut unfortunately I couldn\xe2\x80\x99t.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Yankees rallied with a four-run fourth inning, tying the score with a two-run homer by Swisher, followed by a run-scoring double by Raul Ibanez and a fielder\xe2\x80\x99s choice R.B.I. by Nunez. That gave the Yankees a 4-3 lead. Photo       Hiroki Kuroda, who allowed five runs in five and two-thirds innings, took the loss.

Three National League teams \xe2\x80\x94 San Francisco, Cincinnati and Washington \xe2\x80\x94 have clinched spots in the postseason, and Atlanta seems assured of joining them as a wild-card team. That leaves St. Louis fighting off Milwaukee and the Dodgers for the second wild-card slot. The Brewers\xe2\x80\x99 loss to the Nationals on Monday afternoon made the Cardinals\xe2\x80\x99 task a little easier.The American League is more complicated, and compelling. No one has clinched a postseason spot, although TEXAS started the day with a comfortable four-game lead in the American League West. Baltimore and the Yankees were clinging to each other in the A.L. East division race. Detroit and the White Sox were doing the same in the A.L. Central, and the Angels were still hoping to move up into one of the top two wild-card spots, perhaps at the expense of Oakland, which was beginning a three-game series in Texas.The battle is on. (NYT)ORIOLES AND BLUE JAYS SPLIT J. P. Arencibia broke open a tight game with a seventh-inning grand slam, and Toronto beat host Baltimore, 9-5, to earn a doubleheader split and drop the Orioles to a game and a half out of first place in the A.L. East.In the opener, Adam Jones went 4 for 4 with a homer and two runs batted in to lead Baltimore to a 4-1 win. In the second game, Edwin Encarnacion hit his 41st home run for the Blue Jays, who snapped a seven-game skid.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Adam Jones has waited his entire career to be in a pennant race, and he's making the most of it.Jones went 4 for 4 with a homer and two RBIs, and the Baltimore Orioles moved within a half-game of the AL East lead with a 4-1 victory over the Toronto Blue Jays on Monday in the opener of a doubleheader.Ryan Flaherty hit a solo shot for the Orioles, who matched the division-leading New York Yankees in the win column (88). New York was scheduled to play at Minnesota on Monday night.The victory also solidified Baltimore's grasp on the top AL wild-card slot over Oakland.Jones' four hits tied a career high. He has hit safely in 18 of 22 games in September, with six home runs and 13 RBIs.''Adam relishes competition,'' Orioles manager Buck Showalter said. ''He's obviously had a heck of a year. He's turning into quite a player.''Asked if Jones deserves consideration for AL MVP, Showalter replied, ''This team, we haven't really thought about that type of stuff yet. That will be fodder when our work's done here.''Now in his seventh season, Jones has already set a career high with 32 homers, and his two runs scored put him over 100 for the first time. After enjoying his fifth multi-RBI game this month, the All-Star center fielder needs to drive in three more runs to eclipse his previous high of 83, set last year.Orioles rookie Steve Johnson (4-0) allowed three hits over five shutout innings to lower his ERA to 1.62. Half his big league wins have come against Toronto.Although the Jays got two runners on base in three of the first four innings, Johnson worked out of trouble on each occasion.''When you do that, you have to make a pitch in there, just bear down, throw a few pitches, make sure they don't make good contact on it,'' he said.Jim Johnson, the fifth Baltimore pitcher, worked the ninth for his 48th save in 51 opportunities.It was the seventh straight loss for the Blue Jays, matching a season high. Toronto has been outscored 46-17 during the skid, which began during a three-trip to Yankee Stadium and continued in Tampa Bay.''We can't run from what's taking place, and yet we have to continue to battle,'' Blue Jays manager John Farrell said.Henderson Alvarez (9-14) gave up four runs, eight hits and three walks in 5 2-3 innings. He's 2-7 in his last 10 starts.Speaking through an interpreter, Alvarez addressed the two homers he yielded by saying, ''Pitch to Jones was high changeup. He's a good hitter and he did what he was supposed to do with that pitch. The other kid, the second baseman, (I) felt like it was a good pitch and he did a good job with it.''In the fourth, Chris Davis walked and Jones followed with a drive to left to put Baltimore up 2-0. Flaherty connected in the fifth, and Jones singled in the sixth and came home on a double-play grounder.Toronto scored in the eighth on an RBI double by Rajai Davis. With runners on second and third and two outs, Darren O'Day came in to strike out Kelly Johnson.NOTES: Toronto purchased the contracts of RHPs Shawn Hill and Bobby Korecky and transferred LHP J.A. Happ (foot) to the 60-day DL. ... Orioles LHP Randy Wolf is experiencing discomfort in his left elbow and will undergo an MRI on Tuesday. ... Seventeen of Jones' HRs have given the Orioles the lead. Baltimore is 23-8 when he homers. ... Toronto has lost six straight in Baltimore during a single season for the first time since 1980, and the Orioles won the season series for the first time since 2004.

(Photo: Steven Senne, AP)Story HighlightsDespite loss, Orioles don\'t lose ground on YankeesThe Red Sox avoid a sweep and stopped its four-game losing streakThe Orioles dropped to 27-9 in one-run gamesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBOSTON (AP) -- The Baltimore Orioles ended a successful road trip with a wasted opportunity to climb into a tie for the AL East lead.When Ryan Flaherty struck out with the bases loaded in the ninth inning Sunday, the Red Sox had a 2-1 win and the Orioles headed home after going 6-3 on the journey to Oakland, Seattle and Boston.BOX SCORE: Red Sox 2, Orioles 1""We needed this one. Obviously, going down to this last stretch every game is looked at as a must win,"" Adam Jones said. ""We had a good road trip. We really, really wanted this one to finish off the road trip, but it happens.""The Orioles remained one game behind the New York Yankees and lead the Oakland Athletics by one game for the top wild-card spot in the league. The Athletics beat the Yankees 5-4.The Red Sox snapped a four-game losing streak -- and ended the Orioles six-game winning streak -- but are trying to finish out of the division cellar with their first losing record since 1997.""Coming to Boston, take two out of three, I don\'t care what kind of team we\'re playing or how we\'re playing,"" Baltimore\'s Mark Reynolds said. ""It\'s always big and we keep winning series, and we\'ll see where we\'re at here in a week or two.""The Orioles almost completed a three-game sweep after Cody Ross doubled in the go-ahead run in the eighth. They loaded the bases with one out against Andrew Bailey on a single by Reynolds, a ground-rule double by pinch-hitter Jim Thome and an intentional walk to Chris Davis. But Boston\'s closer got Manny Machado to ground into a forceout at home, then struck out Ryan Flaherty to nail down his sixth save in eight opportunities.""I like to work fast, but sometimes I work too quickly and get ahead of myself,"" Bailey said. ""Today I was able to slow myself down and make the pitches when I needed to.""The decisive run came in when Dustin Pedroia led off the eighth with a double against Luis Ayala (5-5) and Ross followed with his tiebreaking hit.In the first inning, Ross reached over the short right-field wall near Pesky\'s Pole in the corner to take a home run away from Jones.""I didn\'t really know where I was, actually. I thought that the ball was in front of the pole after I had caught it,"" Ross said. ""I ran in and somebody was like \'You just robbed a home run.\' I was like \'I did? All right. Cool.\' ""Junichi Tazawa (1-1) pitched a perfect eighth before the Orioles rally fell short.Baltimore dropped to 27-9 in one-run games.Boston starter Felix Doubront struck out 11 in seven innings, including three each against Robert Andino and Reynolds. Andino returned after being hit in the helmet with a pitch on Friday night.With the pitcher\'s mound in the sun and home plate in a shadow until later in the game, hitters had a tough time picking up pitches, especially from a lefty.""It was tough. Guys were trying sunglasses, no sunglasses, light lens, dark lens,"" Reynolds said. ""Both teams were playing in the same conditions. It\'s probably why the score was 2-1.""Baltimore manager Buck Showalter thought plate umpire Al Porter\'s vision might not have been perfect either. He said Matt Wieters, who led off the ninth by grounding out, should have walked had Porter not called a pitch a strike.""Wieters really walked and we would have scored a run,"" Showalter said, ""but, unfortunately, we weren\'t the only ones having trouble seeing the baseball, it looks like.""After Ross drove in the go-ahead run, Brian Matusz retired Mauro Gomez on a fly ball before highly touted prospect Dylan Bundy made his major league debut with one out and retired both batters he faced on fly balls. Chosen fourth in last year\'s draft, the 19-year-old right-hander was 9-3 with a 2.08 ERA in the minors this year before being called up from Class AA on Wednesday.""I was nervous at first,"" Bundy said. ""I was hoping to get an inning, but getting those first two outs, that inspires me a little bit and, hopefully, the next time I won\'t be as nervous.""Doubront allowed one run on four hits with two walks in his second consecutive solid start after losing his previous five decisions.The Red Sox scored the first run in the fourth when Ross led off with a single and took second on a walk to James Loney. With one out, Danny Valencia grounded to shortstop J.J. Hardy, who threw to second for the first out, but Andino\'s relay into the dirt eluded Reynolds at first base. Ross scored from second, sliding ahead of the attempted tag by Wieters.Doubront held the Orioles hitless through four innings and gave up hits to the first three batters in the fifth. Lew Ford singled, took third on a double by Davis and scored on a single by Machado.Notes: After the game, the Red Sox held a postgame ceremony for Johnny Pesky, who died Aug. 13 at the age of 92 after a baseball career of more than 60 years. He played, managed and served as a broadcaster for the team. ... The Red Sox recalled OF Che-Hsuan Lin from Triple-A Pawtucket... John Lackey, on the disabled list all year following Tommy John elbow surgery, pitched two innings in a Red Sox intrasquad game in Fort Myers, Fla. He threw 26 pitches with three strikeouts, no hits and no walks. ... The Orioles return home to open a four-game series Monday with a doubleheader against the Toronto Blue Jays. Steve Johnson (3-0) pitches for Baltimore against Henderson Alvarez (9-13) in the opener and Wei-Yin Chen (12-9) goes for the Orioles against Rickey Romero (8-14) in the nightcap. ... The Red Sox have a day off before opening their final home series of the season with the first of two games against the Tampa Bay Rays.

The Yankees fell to the Minnesota Twins, 5-4.Earlier this season, all indications were that his path to the major leagues would not be rushed. But Bundy dazzled in the minors, the Orioles pushed into the thick of a playoff race, and a marathon game in Seattle left their bullpen in need of reinforcements.On Sept. 18, the Orioles played an 18-inning game against the Mariners that lasted 5 hours 43 minutes. Bundy, who was 9-3 with a 2.08 earned run average in 23 starts in three minor league cities, was called up from the team\xe2\x80\x99s instructional camp in Sarasota, Fla., the next morning.

He recalled a state semifinal game during Bundy\xe2\x80\x99s junior year in which the opposing team had a runner on second with two outs in a close game.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles dreaded this doubleheader ever since it became part of their schedule late last month.Beating the same team twice on the same day is not an easy task, even if the opposition is a last-place club in the midst of a losing streak. And so, after Toronto earned a split with a 9-5 win Monday night, the Orioles shrugged their shoulders and looked ahead to another day of chasing the New York Yankees in the AL East.""Very hard to sweep a doubleheader in the major leagues,"" Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said. ""It wasn\'t from a lack of effort. That\'s why when you get a rainout, you try to play because you know the challenge ahead of you somewhere down the line. The Blue Jays have a lot of pride.""J.P. Arencibia broke open a tight game with a seventh-inning grand slam, leaving the Orioles 1\xc2\xbd games out of first place in the division.In the opener, Adam Jones went 4 for 4 with a homer and two RBIs to lead Baltimore to a 4-1 victory. But the Orioles lost a half-game in the standings to the Yankees, who won 6-3 at Minnesota.The doubleheader came into being after the teams endured a rainout on Aug. 26.""You never want to play games like this late in the season,"" Baltimore right fielder Chris Davis said. ""But at the same time, if you can win both of them, you help yourself out. Obviously we weren\'t able to do that.""The Orioles fell behind 4-0 in the nightcap and missed several bases-loaded chances to take the lead before Arencibia connected off Jake Arrieta to give Toronto a 9-4 cushion.""I think anytime you strand guys on base you know it\'s a missed opportunity,"" Davis said.Edwin Encarnacion hit his 41st home run for the Blue Jays, who snapped a seven-game skid. Arencibia, who came into the game mired in a 2-for-36 slump, finished with three hits and five RBIs.Toronto long ago fell out of playoff contention, but the Jays were reminded how fun it is while performing before an enthusiastic crowd of 31,015.""It\'s pretty impressive the atmosphere they have here,"" Arencibia said. ""It\'s a lot of fun to play in that kind of atmosphere.""Ricky Romero (9-14) allowed four runs, eight hits, four walks and a homer in five-plus innings. But a strong performance by the Toronto bullpen enabled the left-hander to end a 13-game losing streak over 15 starts since June 22.""Good for him and good for us,"" Blue Jays manager John Farrell said. ""We needed a win and it\'s been a long time since Ricky\'s had a W.""Encarnacion put the Blue Jays up 2-0 against Wei-Yin Chen (12-10) with a two-run drive in the first inning. In the second, Arencibia hit a sacrifice fly and Anthony Gose added an RBI single.Robert Andino singled in two runs in the bottom half, but Baltimore left the bases loaded. Nate McLouth hit an opposite-field drive to left in the fifth to get Baltimore to 4-3, but the Orioles again left the bases full.After Moises Sierra homered for Toronto in the sixth, the Orioles loaded the bases with no outs in their half, bringing many in the crowd to their feet. Brad Lincoln replaced Romero and gave up a first-pitch RBI single to J.J. Hardy before striking out Jones. Davis followed with a fly ball to Gose in left field, and Taylor Teagarden was thrown out at the plate after tagging up.Baltimore also loaded the bases with no outs in the ninth, but scored only once on a double-play grounder.In the first game, Orioles rookie Steve Johnson (4-0) allowed three hits over five shutout innings to lower his ERA to 1.62. Half his big league wins have come against Toronto.Although the Blue Jays got two runners on base in three of the first four innings, Johnson worked out of trouble on each occasion.Jim Johnson, the fifth Baltimore pitcher, worked the ninth for his major league-best 48th save in 51 opportunities.Jones\' four hits tied a career high. Now in his seventh season, Jones has already set career highs with 32 homers and 101 runs, and the All-Star center fielder needs only three RBIs to eclipse his previous high of 83, set last year.Jones added a single and a double in the nightcap and has hit safely in 19 of 23 games in September, with six home runs and 13 RBIs.""Adam relishes competition,"" Showalter said. ""He\'s obviously had a heck of a year. He\'s turning into quite a player.""Henderson Alvarez (9-14) gave up four runs, eight hits and three walks in 5 2-3 innings. He is 2-7 in his last 10 starts.In the fourth, Davis walked and Jones followed with a drive to left to put Baltimore up 2-0. Ryan Flaherty hit a solo shot in the fifth, and Jones singled in the sixth and came home on a double-play grounder.Toronto scored in the eighth on an RBI double by Rajai Davis. With runners on second and third and two outs, Darren O\'Day came in to strike out Kelly Johnson.NOTES: Toronto purchased the contracts of RHPs Shawn Hill and Bobby Korecky and transferred LHP J.A. Happ (foot) to the 60-day DL. ... Orioles LHP Randy Wolf is experiencing discomfort in his left elbow and will undergo an MRI on Tuesday. ... Seventeen of Jones\' HRs have given the Orioles the lead. Baltimore is 23-8 when he homers. ... Toronto\'s first-game defeat was its sixth straight in Baltimore, its longest single-season skid in Charm City since 1980. The Orioles are 10-6 against the Blue Jays, clinching their first season series win over Toronto since 2004. ... Omar Vizquel got two hits to move into a tie with Mel Ott for 40th on the career list with 2,876. ', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles split twin bill with Toronto - birdswatcher.com', 'People shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t dwell too much on the fact that the Baltimore Orioles dropped the nightcap of last night\xe2\x80\x99s doubleheader to Toronto. More often than not teams split twin bills, and its when you get swept in a doubleheader that you should start to worry. The Orioles won the first game 4-1 as a result of Steve Johnson giving the Orioles five solid innings and putting the team in a position to win. As I said, the best teams have a tough time sweeping a twin bill, and in game two the Orioles seemed just a big sluggish. However the 9-5 score in favor of Toronto isn\xe2\x80\x99t indicative of the game itself, as the Orioles battled on numerous occasions to stay in the game.Courtesy of Joy R. Absalon-US PRESSWIREGame one was in effect a bullpen start, although these days it\xe2\x80\x99s tough to decipher who\xe2\x80\x99s a starter and who\xe2\x80\x99s a reliever. Steve Johnson\xe2\x80\x99s line: 5 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 3 BB, 6 K. Adam Jones hit his 32nd homer of the year, this one of the two-run variety. Ryan Flaherty also chimed in with his fifth home run of the season, as the O\xe2\x80\x99s took the game 4-1. Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s an interesting case that I\xe2\x80\x99ll probably touch on a bit this off season. He of course was a rule 5 draft choice out of the Chicago Cubs\xe2\x80\x99 organization, and as a result the O\xe2\x80\x99s had to keep him on their big league roster all season or he\xe2\x80\x99d go back to the Cubs (who at various points of the season made it very clear that they\xe2\x80\x99d like to have him back). At this point of course rosters have expanded and Flaherty\xe2\x80\x99s in no risk of being sent down (and thus back to Chicago), however it\xe2\x80\x99s interesting that a rule five draft choice is contributing for a team in the thick of a pennant race.Wei-Yin Chen didn\xe2\x80\x99t bring his best stuff in game two, although he settled down nicely after the first couple of innings. Edwin Encarnacion his a two-run homer in the first inning to put the Orioles down right off the bat, and Toronto added two more in the second to put themselves ahead 4-0. However Robert Andino\xe2\x80\x98s two-RBI single in the second inning put the O\xe2\x80\x99s right back into the game, and Chen was able to regain some composure. The Orioles managed to leave the bases loaded twice over the course of the game, which tells the story right there. However the death blow for the Birds in this game was J.P. Arencibia\xe2\x80\x98s grand slam in the seventh. To that point the Orioles had battled back through a Nate McLouth homer among other things, however that put Toronto in the driver\xe2\x80\x99s seat by a long shot.By virtue of New York beating Minnesota, the Orioles dropped 1.5 games behind in the AL East, however Oakland lost last night at Texas so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t lose any ground in the Wild Card race. The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 magic number to clinch a playoff spot now stands at six games. Again, that means any combination of Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 wins and L.A. Angels\xe2\x80\x99 losses equaling six clinches a playoff spot for the O\xe2\x80\x99s. For the record, L.A. hosts Seattle tonight with Zack Greinke pitching for the Angels and Erasmo Ramirez for Seattle. Orioles fans need to turn into Mariners\xe2\x80\x99 supporters on the side for the next couple of days!The Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 series with Toronto continues tonight, and mercifully it\xe2\x80\x99s only one game! (These doubleheaders throw a lot of people off in a lot of different ways; but come the off season doubleheaders are another thing I might take a look at in terms of pros and cons.) Joe Saunders will get the ball for the O\xe2\x80\x99s, coming off of his best start since being traded to Baltimore. Unfortunately he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have anything to show for it since he didn\xe2\x80\x99t figured into the decision as the game went to the 11th inning. Saunders will be opposed by Toronto\xe2\x80\x99s Aaron Laffey, who\xe2\x80\x99s lost four straight decisions and is battling command issues. All of these games are big from here on out\xe2\x80\xa6the Orioles need to jump on Toronto early tonight to remove any drama from the game early on, and to get the Baltimore faithful singing that Seven Nation Army song for the duration of the game!\xc2\xa0 ', 'birdswatcher.com')]"

That has pushed Logan\xe2\x80\x99s total appearances this season to 77, a career high, and it also qualifies as the most times Girardi has called on a pitcher in his six seasons as a manager.Such is the nature of this extended American League East race, where the Orioles and Yankees have been no further than a game and a half apart in the standings since Sept. 3. Calling on the group of Dave Robertson, Rafael Soriano and especially Logan has mostly worked for Girardi this month, until Tuesday when Logan imploded.After Phil Hughes had pitched effectively over six innings, Logan was called upon to secure the final out of the seventh inning with the bases loaded. But instead he was on the mound when four runs scored as the Minnesota Twins rallied to beat the Yankees, 5-4, at Target Field.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m upset that A, we lost, and B, that I gave up those runs,\xe2\x80\x9d Logan said. \xe2\x80\x9cI had four lefties in a row to get out and I only got one of them out and there\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse.

They say they're concentrating on the last-place Toronto Blue Jays.They will need to concentrate harder.On Tuesday night, the Orioles lost for the second straight game, 4-0 to the Blue Jays.Baltimore remained 1 1-2 games behind first-place New York in the AL East. The Yankees lost 5-4 at Minnesota.After Boston's loss, Adam Jones said it was vital to ignore the Yankees.''Trying to get more runs on our scoreboard,'' Jones said.For the first time since Aug. 3, Baltimore was shut out as Aaron Laffey and five relievers combined on a six-hitter.Laffey (4-6) allowed five singles in 5 2-3 innings and won his first game since Aug. 5. He had been winless in his previous six starts. He neither walked nor struck out a batter.''Honestly, he's running on fumes. His stuff is not as sharp and crisp, but you can't take anything away from what he did tonight. He's gone out there on really some guile tonight,'' Toronto manager John Farrell said.Relievers Steve Delabar, Brett Cecil, Brandon Lyon, Darren Oliver and Casey Janssen combined to allow one hit - Chris Davis' seventh-inning double - in 3 1-3 innings.The Orioles loaded the bases in the ninth on an error and two walks, but Ryan Flaherty flied out on the first pitch of his at-bat to end the game.''He's the tying run there,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''He just missed that ball, hitting it out of the ballpark.''On Monday, Baltimore and Toronto split a doubleheader, with the Blue Jays winning the second game 9-5. The Orioles had just four runners in scoring position.Baltimore leads the season series 10-7 with one game remaining on Wednesday.''You're always going to get everyone's best shot and when we had been struggling and we'd go into certain venues where there's a good emotion in the ballpark, it feeds the other team as well as us,'' Showalter said.The Orioles had won seven of their previous nine.''We got to get some wins. That's what we've been doing since the first day of spring training. Now, we're just in a position where each game matters. It's a cool position to be in,'' Jones said.Joe Saunders (2-3) pitched 6 1-3 innings, allowing four runs - three earned - and 11 hits. He struck out two and walked none.''I didn't feel I had my best stuff, but I feel like I kept my team in the game as best I could. I think we've played like 100 innings the last five days, so bullpen's pretty burnt up, so I had to go as deep as I could,'' Saunders said.The Orioles played an 18-inning game in Seattle a week ago, another 11 innings against the Mariners the next night, and 12 innings in Boston last Saturday.''I think we're fine. I think we might be a little bit tired, but we just have to push through, especially at this time of the year, dig down deep and find whatever you have and compete the best you can. That's about it,'' Saunders said.In the first inning, the Blue Jays took a 1-0 lead on Yan Gomes' RBI single that scored Brett Lawrie, who led off with a single.Rajai Davis beat out an infield single with two outs in the fourth and scored on Adeiny Hechavarria's double.In the seventh, Colby Rasmus and Edwin Encarnacion had consecutive RBI singles to give Toronto a 4-0 lead.''They came up with clutch hits, not really hard hits, but just kind of dinked it in there,'' Saunders said.Dylan Bundy made his second appearance for Baltimore. The 19-year-old pitched a scoreless ninth, but allowed his first hit.NOTES: Orioles LHP Randy Wolf, who's suffering from discomfort in his pitching elbow, will consult with orthopedist Dr. Lewis Yocum before settling on his next step. Yocum performed Tommy John surgery on Wolf's left elbow in 2005. ... Baltimore RHP Jason Hammel, who's been out with a bad right knee, threw about 35 pitches off the mound.

Vasquez, US Presswire)Story HighlightsShowalter turns around team in second full yearOrioles a far from a finished productShowalter has used 50 players and a couple more prospects ready to debutCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREBALTIMORE -- Not sure yet why the Baltimore Orioles are more and more likely to be part of this year\'s playoffs?You\'ve seen the stats, maybe sorted them every which way or printed out the numbers. They don\'t add up.Try visiting Camden Yards -- even the long-frustrated folks in Baltimore finally are doing that in increasing numbers.Walk into the Orioles clubhouse, and you\'ll see a camaraderie and a nonchalance that only raises the question -- does that atmosphere breed winning, or does winning breed the confidence?But there still are few concrete clues to how a team that has been outscored this season leads the wild-card race and has been  tied for the American League East lead with the New York Yankees or one game behind New York every day since Labor Day.Out on the field is what seems for all the world like a normal batting practice. Eventually, though, one more Oriole emerges from the tunnel behind home plate.Buck Showalter stops and chats with a coach here, a news reporter there, checks in with a couple of players around the batting cage, eventually wanders around the outfield, striking up a series of conversations, with an ever-present fungo bat at his side.It\'s a daily ritual for the manager, who also carries the only thing resembling a track record that might explain the phenomenon that is his team.Showalter could be excused for requiring ""Hi, I\'m "" stickers on a team that has used 50 players already and has a couple more prospects on the roster ready to debut any day.But make no mistake, the players know him, his record, his reputation, his expectations.""I think Buck\'s been a big change,"" catcher Matt Wieters said. ""Everybody\'s more comfortable with him. It\'s a big thing when you know what your manager is going to expect out of you and you can count on what he\'s going to do for you every day.""Compare that with Adam Jones\' comments.""It\'s just that his presence, well, you can just feel the change,"" the center fielder said. ""Everybody knows his reputation around here. They know it as someone who\'s going to get on you, and it\'s working for us. He\'s looking at all the small things that are going on.""Jones\' comments came nearly two years to the day before Wieters\', not long after Showalter took over a 32-73 team stumbling through the 2010 season.""We need an identity as a franchise,"" said Andy MacPhail, team president at the time. ""We need somebody who can put his stamp on this team.""Mission accomplished. And if you think the numbers indicate the Orioles\' success is some sort of fluky accident, consider these numbers.This is Showalter\'s second full season as Orioles manager, and entering the week they were on a pace to win 93 games, which would be a 24-game improvement over last year. In 2004, Showalter\'s second full year with the Texas Rangers, they improved by 18 games and he was AL manager of the year.In Showalter\'s second full year with the Arizona Diamondbacks (1999), he led a 35-game improvement. His second full year with the New York Yankees (1993) resulted in a 12-game improvement.Showalter shrugs off the obvious trend, even comes back with, ""Yeah, and what\'s the next question?""He knows. The year after he was replaced in both New York and Arizona, those teams won the World Series. Showalter will joke about it \xe2\x80\x94 once even told his Baseball Tonight colleagues at ESPN they could expect an Emmy after he left to return to managing \xe2\x80\x94 but it\'s a sensitive spot.Creating a winner doesn\'t occur overnight, says the ultra-organized manager, even if this year\'s Orioles are something of an overnight sensation. Not if you want to sustain the success.""I see a lot of teams that try to cheat the process. You  can\'t  cheat  the  process,"" he says slowly and with emphasis. ""You have to know who you are and know who you\'re not.""Putting onus on playersFrom the outside, these Orioles are a team battling to get on the plus side of scoring for the first time since June 26, hardly fitting for one that long ago clinched the franchise\'s first winning record since 1997. And any day now the Orioles might actually have more runs than they\'ve allowed this season \xe2\x80\x94 a recent six-game winning streak  whittled the deficit  to five.Their 16-2 extra-inning record defies explanation \xe2\x80\x94 the 16 wins are an ongoing streak and the longest in baseball since the Cleveland Indians won 17 in 1949.Since July 17, the Orioles are 41-21, including 11 one-run and 11 two-run wins. Overall, they\'re 52-32 in one- and two-run games. They lead the AL with 45 road wins and have won nine of 11 series on the road in the AL East. They\'re 68-0 when leading after seven innings, led by a bullpen that has allowed five earned runs in the 60 extra innings they\'ve played.No wonder the Orioles won\'t go away. Still, how?""We like each other,"" Showalter said.More important to him is that his players like each other. When he first showed up, players said knowing Showalter was likely to be around for a while had a positive effect on their effort.Showalter, though, described himself to the players as just someone passing through.""I understand how shelf life works,"" he said of the inevitability of a manager getting fired, especially one like himself whose attention to detail and demand for fundamentals are legendary.""Most coaches and managers forget how hard this game is. I understand, but I won\'t give in (on demanding the basics).""What he really desires, he said, is peer pressure.""One of the things I\'m looking for in my players is whether they care about what their teammates think,"" Showalter said. ""If they care about pleasing their teammates, then it bodes well for us. They don\'t want to let each other down.""It wasn\'t always that way. When the Orioles hired him, it was his first experience taking over a team during a season.Late in that 2010 season, he described his frustration:""I have to slow down,"" he said. ""Just because there are a lot of things you want to do. Sometimes I\'ll see something and want to say, \'Stop, can we start spring training right now?\' ""Getting most out of rosterMacPhail, whom Showalter lauds for many of the player acquisitions that helped build the current team, left the franchise after last season. Dan Duquette took over as general manager last offseason and has embraced with Showalter the concept of using every bit of their 40-man roster and more.They solidified the successful bullpen. They got through the first half of the season with pretty much a set rotation and haven\'t stopped patching it since, with late-season acquisitions Joe Saunders and Randy Wolf boosting the number of starters used to 12.They have gotten contributions from veteran Jim Thome and resurrected outfielder Lew Ford, who had been out of the majors since 2007. The surprise promotion of teenager Manny Machado increased the buzz in town and created an instant hero. Now, fellow teen phenom Dylan Bundy is with the team, and the right-hander  just might be the next secret weapon.It all goes back to Showalter\'s dictum of knowing who you are.""We\'ll talk about a player and say that doesn\'t work for us in Baltimore,"" he said. ""Let\'s don\'t waste a lot of mind power talking about, say, Cecil Fielder coming here. He ain\'t coming here.""That was last winter. Dial back your memory a bit further, and there was a time when a packed Camden Yards was a destination for free agents.""If we do some good things, we\'ll start attracting people,"" Showalter said.They\'re attracting fans, who have warmed to the team over the second half and should put the annual attendance over 2 million for the first time since 2007.""Our players have gotten a taste of it,"" Showalter said of the amped-up ballpark atmosphere. ""Don\'t think they don\'t notice.""Just as Showalter was careful all season to temper the expectations for a team even he wasn\'t certain how long could remain in the race, he knows the Orioles are far from a finished product.""Just be glad you\'re relevant"" was his message. ""I just want to be a part of the Orioles being relevant.""But he also recalled what he said was among the best advice he had ever received as a manager: not to fall in love with players he assembled with the expansion Diamondbacks. Few, if any, would be there when the team became successful.""Don\'t drink the Kool-Aid,"" he said, applying the advice to these Orioles. ""You\'re looking at some guys who have maybe a little overachieved and things have snowballed.""It\'s gotten to the point now, though, that there\'s hardly time left for that snowball to melt.""If you get a chance in September, anything can happen,"" Wieters said. ""Coming out of spring training, it was more of a professional feel. It wasn\'t like, \'Oh, my God, what are we doing?\' We\'re still young, but at the same time we have more experience, more maturity.""At this point, Showalter says, he\'s more likely to stay out of his players\' way.""I\'m not going to  say, \'OK, X number of games left,\' "" he said. ""You\'ve got to be careful about stating the obvious, things that make them say, \'no (bull).\' ""The Orioles\' season needs no explanation at this point. It\'s too late for that.""It just verifies the game isn\'t played with a computer,"" Showalter said. ""Hey, ability plays. And sometimes you\'ve got to give it up that money and talent, which is one and the same, can overpower the game.""But it\'s also played with effort and heart and guts.""CONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMORE ', 'www.usatoday.com')]"

It came in chest-high to Edwin Encarnacion, who lashed it into the right-field corner for a two-run double that may have determined Nova\xe2\x80\x99s fate for the rest of the season.In a game the Yankees needed to win to put a safer distance between them and the idle Baltimore Orioles, Nova had another in a series of bad outings, jeopardizing the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 position atop the American League East as well as his standing in the rotation.He gave up four runs and six hits in four and two-thirds innings, and the last-place Toronto Blue Jays went on to win, 6-0.

Nova tried to throw a slider out of the strike zone, but it dangled almost at eye level for Encarnacion, the No. 3 hitter, who drove a bouncing double into the right-field corner. Ichiro Suzuki had trouble picking it up, and both runners scored as the Jays surged ahead, 4-0, providing more frustration for Nova.

The Orioles won 12-2. (AP Photo/Nick Wass)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- After losing two straight games to Toronto, the Baltimore Orioles broke out the big bats.The Orioles tied a team record by with seven home runs to rout the Blue Jays 12-2 and stay within 1 1/2 games of the AL East lead.Chris Davis and Manny Machado each connected twice and the Orioles remained close to the division-leading New York Yankees, who won 8-2 in Minnesota.Nate McLouth hit a leadoff shot in the first inning and Jim Thome and Mark Reynolds also homered. Baltimore has hit seven home runs three times, most recently on Aug. 26, 1985.''Home runs are very unique, and when you do what we did tonight, it's something to be proud of. It's something that doesn't happen a whole lot in the game,'' Thome said.Thome's home run was the 612th of his career and the first he's hit at home for the Orioles.''Up and down the lineup, everyone swung the bat well. It's been fun,'' Thome said.Davis finished with a career-high five RBIs to help the Orioles split a four-game series with the last-place Blue Jays.''This was a tough series. It was one of those ones that you don't want to see at the end of the season coming in off a long road trip,'' Davis said.''I think if you'd have told us a few months ago that we'd be a game-and-a-half out with six games left, I think you'd be pretty happy with that.''Beginning Friday, the Orioles have three games with Boston at home and three at Tampa Bay.''We just got through playing Boston and we played them well. Obviously, the three in Tampa are going to be tough, but we're at a point where we still have a chance, so that's all you can ask for,'' Davis said.The Orioles trailed 2-1 heading into the bottom of the fifth before hitting three home runs.Thome led off with his third homer since joining the Orioles. With two outs, Machado hit his fifth of the year for a 3-2 Baltimore lead. All of Machado's home runs have come at home, and his drive was the Orioles' 200th homer of the year.Davis' three-run drive gave the Orioles a five-run inning and finished Carlos Villanueva (7-7).Villanueva equaled a career high by giving up four home runs.''Those mistakes I made, they hit them with authority. They put the power stroke on them and made me pay for them,'' Villanueva said.Machado and Thome are the first AL teammates to hit home runs in the same inning with an age difference of more than 20 years, according to home run historian David Vincent.Thome is 42 and Machado is 20 - Thome's major league career began 10 months before Machado was born.''That's crazy,'' Machado said. ''It's a pretty good stat. I remember when I used to watch (Thome) play when I was a little kid. Now to hit a home run in the same inning he did, just feels great.''Davis hit his second home run in the seventh. On Aug. 24, he hit three home runs against the Blue Jays, also in a game started by Villanueva. He has 28 home runs.Reynolds hit his 23rd homer in the sixth and Machado added a two-run shot in the eighth.Miguel Gonzalez (8-4) allowed two runs and five hits in seven innings. He allowed Edwin Encarnacion's 42nd home run with two outs in the top of the first.With one out in the fifth, J.P. Arencibia, who went 7 for 9 in the four-game series, doubled and scored on Anthony Gose's single.NOTES: Orioles LHP Randy Wolf was put on the 60-day disabled list with a torn ligament in his left elbow. Baltimore purchased the contract of INF-OF Bill Hall from Triple-A Norfolk. Hall will provide outfield help while Lew Ford is out with a groin injury. ...

The Orioles, who had lost 93 games, refused to let that happen.The ripple effect from Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s 4-3 win on that warm Wednesday night has carried the teams on divergent paths, almost as reflective images of each other. In the 12 months since its loss, Boston has languished near the bottom of the American League East standings, and now the Red Sox are cast in the spoiler role against the wild-card-leading Orioles, who are seeking their first postseason appearance since 1997.Baltimore took care of its business Friday, beating the Red Sox, 9-1. The Orioles pounded Boston\xe2\x80\x99s starter, Aaron Cook, for six runs in the first inning, four on a grand slam by Ryan Flaherty. The scoring continued in the fifth, as four consecutive hits \xe2\x80\x94 three for extra bases \xe2\x80\x94 brought three more runs around. Baltimore had 11 hits in its first 24 at-bats.That killed any real suspense, and the fans reveled in the role reversal from a year ago.How Baltimore (90-67) got to this point \xe2\x80\x94 staying neck and neck with the Yankees for the division crown over the last month \xe2\x80\x94 could be traced to Game 162 a year ago, a win that still stings in Boston. The Red Sox blew a 3-2 lead in the ninth, then watched as the Tampa Bay Rays\xe2\x80\x99 Evan Longoria hit a game-ending home run to beat the Yankees and snatch a trip to the postseason from Boston\xe2\x80\x99s grasp. The Red Sox at one point had held a nine-game lead.

But his play at 3rd base has made all the difference in turning a porous defense into a team asset.

He could hear the crowd\xe2\x80\x99s roar from beneath the concrete stands.They bellowed for an Orioles legend before the game \xe2\x80\x94 a parade of legends, in fact, as other Hall of Famers arrived to commemorate Robinson. But they kept cheering for Baltimore\xe2\x80\x99s budding star, Machado, a 20-year-old third baseman from Florida whose slick fielding and punchy bat have brought a unique flair to the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 eclectic mix.Machado\xe2\x80\x99s go-ahead home run in the seventh inning Saturday lifted Baltimore past the Boston Red Sox, 4-3, and into a tie for first place in the American League East with four games left in the regular season.\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m just trying to be me,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to do it on this night felt great.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 victory, coupled with the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 3-2 loss to Toronto in the afternoon, capped a memorable night for Baltimore, which has not made the postseason since 1997.

The fans were well aware of what was at stake.So were the players, although it would not have been terribly apparent. In the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse hours before the game, only one of the three televisions was tuned to the end of the Yankees-Blue Jays game. A handful of players watched.When Alex Rodriguez hit a ball to center field, Orioles catcher Matt Wieters gasped. As the ball settled into an outfielder\xe2\x80\x99s glove, completing the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 defeat, Adam Jones gave a small fist pump, then turned around in his chair and fiddled with his phone.

When I was Brendan\xe2\x80\x99s age, in 1955, I boasted the largest card collection in my Washington neighborhood \xe2\x80\x94 hundreds filling two large boxes. The cards in those days were not for collecting. They were for bartering, trading and learning the career statistics of favorite players.Roaming the card show with two boys hunting for a Michael Jordan rookie card, I was shocked to discover that a 1955 Mickey Mantle card listed for $2,400. I asked a couple of vendors if they had any old Washington Senators cards. They stared back blankly. We were in Year 18 of the exile of Washington baseball from the nation\xe2\x80\x99s capital.The Senators had left for Texas after the 1971 season, the second team in a little more than a decade to desert Washington. I paused at a table and thumbed through an aged binder. Suddenly, my legs felt weak. Staring up at me through the plastic-sheet protector was the 1952 Topps card of Eddie Yost, hero of my youth, presenter at the Nativity School C.Y.O. awards dinner and longtime Senators third baseman. I turned the card over. On the back was the information we memorized as children: 154 games, .283 batting average, 109 runs.I thought I was hallucinating. I had spent every penny I had on those Topps cards, which cost a nickel a pack at the drugstore in our Fort Stevens neighborhood. (Fort Stevens was our local monument, the Civil War site where Lincoln came to see the action during one battle and was almost shot.) By the sixth grade, I had a most impressive collection, but I cared only about the cards of my team.

They won the pennant in 1924, 1925 and 1933, and the World Series in 1924. They hosted the president 40 times on opening day. Their greatest star was pitcher Walter Johnson, who won 417 games and set a career strikeout record that lasted for 55 years.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  From the arrival of Johnson through the 1930s, the team was respectable, averaging 76 wins. In the first half of the \xe2\x80\x9940s, with most of the best players serving in World War II, the Senators cobbled together teams that finished second in 1943 and in 1945. Then came the long descent to baseball oblivion. Unfortunately, I was born in 1945.The team was owned by Clark Griffith, who looked like a grandfather in a Frank Capra movie. Hired to manage the team in 1912, Griffith bought a controlling interest in 1920 and ran it as a mom-and-pop operation until his death in 1955. He depended on rent from the Washington Redskins and colleges and high schools in the area to pay his bills. The Senators had $25,000 in the bank when he died.From 1940 to 1950, Griffith Stadium was also a home to the Homestead Grays of the Negro leagues. The Grays featured Josh Gibson and Buck Leonard, two of the greatest players in baseball history. If the Senators had signed them, who knows how history might have changed? Today, Gibson, Leonard and four of their teammates are in the Washington Nationals\xe2\x80\x99 Ring of Honor.

As the trolley drew closer to the stadium, we became more excited. Why not? We were tied for first. We joined the crowd entering the stadium, our senses overwhelmed by the mingled smells of hot dogs, peanuts, cotton candy, and the bread baking next door at the Wonder Bread factory.We went up the ramp to the upper deck. I looked out in awe on the greenest expanse I\xe2\x80\x99d ever seen. Griffith Stadium was built in 1912. Like most stadiums of that era, it was integrated into the neighborhood. It had a covered grandstand and two decks of seats \xe2\x80\x94 bleacher seats in left and center, and a 30-foot wall in right. It seated about 30,000 for baseball and looked like Fenway Park in reverse. The dimensions of the park were so huge that only one Senator hit a home run there in 1945.

The Senators had a Cuban scout named Joe Cambria, and the team was loaded with players from the Caribbean who worked cheaply and spoke little English. The manager was Chuck Dressen, who had twice guided the Brooklyn Dodgers to the World Series.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The opponents were the hated Baltimore Orioles. I gloated as the Senators won, 12-5, to take over first place. But they won only 52 more games that year.I spent much of my time scheming to get back to Griffith Stadium, even persuading my sports-agnostic mother to take my 4-year-old sister, Maureen, and me to a Ladies\xe2\x80\x99 Day game. For my mother, the draw was her favorite radio personality, Arthur Godfrey, who was appearing with his horse after the game.

Flaherty hit a first-inning grand slam moments after Chris Davis belted a two-run homer, and Tillman threw eight innings of one-hit baseball to help the Orioles to a 9-1 victory over the Boston Red Sox.  The Orioles (90-67) are trying to lock up their first playoff spot since 1997, and they could do that with three wins in their last five games, regardless of what any other team does.  Flaherty later added an RBI double and finished 2-for-4 with a career-high five RBI. The Orioles, who homered seven times in their last game, finished with two this time and set a new franchise record for homers in a season at Camden Yards with 122.  Flaherty\'s gotten several chances recently after second baseman Robert Andino was hit in the head in Boston last Friday night. Since manager Buck Showalter gave Flaherty some more playing time at second base, he\'s hit two homers, two doubles, a triple and driven in eight runs.  ""You don\'t know when opportunities are going to come, so when you do get a chance ... you take advantage of them,"" Flaherty said. ""Anything you can to do help this team win this team of the year.""  Flaherty has come on late after spending much of August on the disabled list (bacterial infection). He seemed to turn things around after playing nine games with Triple-A Norfolk, batting .289 in a rehab assignment.  Norfolk manager Ron Johnson is assisting the Orioles at times this month and was very impressed when working with Flaherty in August and again on this night.  ""He\'s got a production bat,"" Johnson said. ""He can do damage when he swings and he gets pitches to hit, and that\'s the thing that impresses me about him.""  Boston scored a run in the first when leadoff hitter Scott Podsednik reached on a bunt single and went to second on second baseman Flaherty\'s throwing error when he tried to make a bare-handed play. Podsednik moved to third on a Pedro Ciriaco sacrifice and scored on a Dustin Pedroia sacrifice fly for a quick 1-0 lead.  But the Red Sox (69-88) couldn\'t do anything else against Tillman (9-2), who held them to that one hit. Tillman mixed his pitches, stayed ahead in the count throughout and shut down Boston to won his fourth straight decision.  The right-hander also retired the final 14 batters he faced.  ""We were behind his fastball most of the time, we were out in front of his breaking ball,"" Boston manager Bobby Valentine said. ""He had a good curveball. He threw effectively, and we didn\'t solve him.""  Showalter considered sending Tillman out to finish the game, but instead put in Troy Patton. The left-hander finished the job and limited the Red Sox to that one hit.  ""(Tillman) was good, really good,"" Showalter said. ""It was one of those games we were confident he could finish but what\'s best for him is best for us. He had a good four-pitch mix going and stayed in the strike zone.""  Tillman\'s had some problems in the early innings this season. In fact, 15 of the 35 runs he\'s allowed have come in the first inning. But Tillman bounced back and only two batters reached in the final seven frames.  ""I felt pretty good with all my stuff, and I was confident in the fact that we were able to get ahead, and I was able to throw strikes,"" Tillman said. ""I feel like I\'m confident in my delivery, and when you have confidence in that, things will play out well for you.""  Things also will play out well when your teammates help on offense. Davis added two RBI, and Manny Machado went 2-for-4 with two RBI as the Orioles banged out 12 hits.  After Tillman gave up that run in the top of the first, the Orioles very answered quickly with six runs off Aaron Cook (4-11) in the bottom of the inning.  Nate McLouth led off with a single and scored when Davis lined his one-out homer to right-center for a 2-1 lead. Jim Thome started the rest of the rally with a two-out single to left, and Mark Reynolds walked.  Machado singled to left, but Thome was held at third, loading the bases. Flaherty then crushed a 2-1 pitch into the seats in right-center to give Baltimore an early 6-1 lead.  Cook lasted just one inning plus two batters and threw 42 pitches -- only 18 of which were strikes. He gave up six runs on five hits, including the two homers in the six-run first inning.  This was the shortest start of Cook\'s career.  Alfredo Aceves took over in the second and pitched well until running into trouble in the fifth. Machado and Reynolds hit back-to-back RBI doubles followed by a Taylor Teagarden RBI single for a 9-1 Baltimore lead.

Jason Hammel still continues to try to come back from the knee problems that have dogged him throughout the second half of the season.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) -- Chris Tillman already has more wins in 2012 than the combined total over his first three years in the big leagues.That might come as a shock, except nothing the Baltimore Orioles do this season is all that surprising anymore.Tillman pitched eight innings of one-hit ball, Ryan Flaherty hit his first career grand slam and the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 9-1 on Friday night remain a game out of first place in the AL East.Chris Davis hit a two-run homer as the Orioles kept pace with the division-leading Yankees, who beat Toronto 11-4. Baltimore also tightened its grip on the top AL wild-card spot.Tillman (9-2) gave up a bunt single to leadoff hitter Scott Podsednik, then allowed only two walks the rest of the way in his longest outing since July 4. The right-hander retired the final 14 batters he faced, and the only run he allowed was unearned.Tillman came to spring training with a 7-15 lifetime record. Although he pitched well in camp, he began the season with Triple-A Norfolk and remained there until July. In his last 12 starts, the 24-year-old is 8-1 with a 3.00 ERA and has become one of the most effective starters on the staff.''He's one win away from winning 10 games, but we hopefully have bigger fish to fry,'' manager Buck Showalter said. ''He keeps putting himself in a position to be worthy of getting the ball.''Said Tillman: ''I feel like I'm confident in my delivery, and when you have confidence in that, things will play out well for you. I just got to take it pitch-by-pitch and not get too worried about the next inning or the next game. One step at a time.''Troy Patton worked the ninth to complete the one-hitter.It was the 90th win for the Orioles, who went 69-93 last season. If Baltimore wins three of its last five games it will make the postseason, regardless of how the other contenders fare.Boston has lost 14 of 20. Starter Aaron Cook (4-11) went one-plus innings, allowing six runs, five hits and three walks. Only 18 of his 42 pitches were strikes.''I wasn't making pitches. I was behind, and when I did come in there they hit balls over the fence,'' Cook said.Asked what he might have done differently to be successful, Cook replied, ''Not walk (anyone) and not give up hits.''Flaherty, a Rule 5 rookie, became the latest in a long line of heroes during the Orioles' improbable season. He was batting .225 with five homers and 14 RBIs in 72 games before connecting to cap a six-run first inning that included a two-run drive by Davis.Flaherty also doubled in a run in the fifth. The five RBIs were two more than his previous career high, and it was only the third time he drove in more than one run in a game.''Yeah, it seems like every night it's someone new,'' Flaherty said. ''Whether it is a pitcher, a hitter, a play in the field, something. We'll keep riding it.''Baltimore has hit nine homers in its last two games and has 122 at home, eclipsing the season record of 121 set in 1996.In addition, the Orioles reached a positive run differential - 697-690 - for the first time since June 24.Boston scored an unearned run in the first inning. Podsednik bunted to the right side and reached second when Flaherty's throw went wide of first baseman Mark Reynolds. Two batters later, Dustin Pedroia hit a sacrifice fly.In the bottom half, Nate McLouth singled on Cook's first pitch and Davis hit a drive into the seats in right. After two singles and a walk loaded the bases, Flaherty sent a 2-1 breaking ball deep into the night for a 6-1 lead.Successive doubles by Reynolds, Manny Machado and Flaherty, along with an RBI single by Taylor Teagarden, made it 9-1 in the fifth.NOTES: Orioles C Matt Wieters wasn't at the ballpark after his wife gave birth to the couple's first child, Maverick Luther, earlier in the day. ... Red Sox CF Jacoby Ellsbury, out since Sept. 20 with an unspecified injury, could return to the lineup as soon as Saturday, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said. ... Orioles rookie Steve Johnson (4-0) will start on Saturday night against Felix Doubront, who's got a 2.08 ERA in three starts against Baltimore this year. ... The crowd of 33,518 boosted home attendance for the season over 2 million for the first time since 2007. ... Cook is 0-3 with an 11.93 ERA in four starts against the Orioles in 2012.

All year the Orioles had sifted through the scrap heap and shipped former All-Stars and wanna-bes alike to the minors to be evaluated by Johnson, a baseball lifer with a keen eye for talent. Johnson had been watching the newest addition, the short outfielder with wavy blond surfer hair and a sculpted physique, and he finally snapped after the guy swung defensively and hit weakly to left. var adSkipCounter = 0;  The husky Johnson lumbered over to the 30-year-old and said, ""Let me ask you a question. Aren\'t you Nate McLouth?"" A sly smile \xe2\x80\x94 one that his friends say is his mischievous trademark \xe2\x80\x94 crossed McLouth\'s lips. He immediately understood Johnson\'s point, responding with, ""Let it eat?"" \xe2\x80\x94 baseball jargon meaning, ""You want me to be more aggressive and get after it?"" ""Absolutely. Be who you are. You\'ve won a Gold Glove. You\'ve put up major numbers in the big leagues. You\'re a good player. You\'re not old."" Johnson said to McLouth that night. ""I mean, this guy should be in his prime,"" Johnson said. ""So I don\'t know if that had anything to do with it, but it helped. And it got crazy. He hit like nine home runs in a month. ""And we got that player again. He is Nate McLouth again."" A trade that ""broke his heart"" Baseball is filled with stories of players who seize a team and a town in a breakout season only to fizzle and fade a few years later, whether it\'s the travel grind or the intense competition or the inevitable injuries that sound a promising career\'s premature death knell. McLouth was that guy, a 26-year-old homegrown All-Star and Gold Glover in 2008 with the Pittsburgh Pirates. The next February, he signed a three-year, $13.75 million extension to be the club\'s cornerstone. To put it in Orioles\' terms, he was Pittsburgh\'s Nick Markakis, only in a smaller, Brian Roberts-sized package. ""It was the only place I ever played,"" said McLouth, now the Orioles\' starting left fielder. ""I played at every level of the minor leagues there. \xe2\x80\xa6 And as long as it had been since the organization had won, I was really enjoying the process of trying to help turn that around and being a part of that."" Then the unexpected struck. Roughly four months after signing his lucrative deal, the feckless Pirates traded McLouth to the perennially contending Atlanta Braves. In search of an athletic, young center fielder, Atlanta offered talented right-hander Charlie Morton and two of their top seven prospects, lefty Jeff Locke and outfielder Gorkys Hernandez. The Pirates had future MVP candidate Andrew McCutchen playing center in the minors, and their pitching depth was suspect. ""They felt like it was a trade they couldn\'t pass up,"" said Orioles bench coach John Russell, who at the time was the Pirates\' manager. ""But I think it was a little bit of a shock to us and to Nate, just signing a multi-year deal and thinking he is going to be there and then all of a sudden to get traded."" For some, leaving baseball\'s purgatory for the Braves would be a godsend. It wasn\'t for McLouth, a small-town type from western Michigan who is described as unfailingly loyal by his friends. McLouth broke down in tears during an interview after the deal was announced. ""It was tough. Just those personal relationships,"" McLouth said. ""You see the product on the field. You see the game on the field. But the stuff in the dugout and the clubhouse and in spring training, you don\'t see. You don\'t see the human part of it. I knew that was going to be the toughest part to leave behind."" Bill Peterson, who once managed a teenage McLouth on a travel team and has become one of his closest friends, was playing Guitar Hero in a Pittsburgh apartment with McLouth when the phone rang. ""You could tell part of him was excited to join a contender that\'s constantly in the playoff race, and that was intriguing to him,"" Peterson said. ""But the flip side is Nate is a very loyal man. So it broke his heart to a degree to have it all go down like that."" ""Too much pressure on himself"" McLouth was OK in his first half year in Atlanta, putting up serviceable numbers: .257 average, .354 on-base percentage, 11 homers and 12 steals in 84 games. But the next two seasons were disastrous, both injury-riddled and ineffective. He batted a combined .210 with just 10 homers and 11 stolen bases and played basically half a season each year. It\'s the $13.75 million question that has haunted McLouth. Why did it all go so badly in Atlanta? There are plenty of theories. ""One thing is he had a major hamstring injury in 2009 in the first month or so he was there,"" said his father, Rick McLouth. ""Between that and battling other nagging things and performing below his expectations, maybe he put too much pressure on himself."" His old Pirates teammate, Ryan Doumit, thinks McLouth simply wasn\'t prepared mentally for moving on.1 | 2 | 3 |  Next     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Absalon, US PRESSWIRE)Story HighlightsThe Orioles haven't made the playoffs since 1997Re-purposed veterans such as Nate McLouth and Chris Davis have had a huge impactCloser Jim Johnson has 50 saves in 53 opportunitiesBaltimore is 28-9 in one-run gamesCONNECTTWEETLINKEDINCOMMENTEMAILMOREAll together now: The Baltimore Orioles are going to the playoffs.Not since 1997 has postseason baseball been contested in Charm City, a period that saw a proud franchise deteriorate and fans grow disillusioned by owner Peter Angelos' questionable management.But by virtue of the Los Angeles Angels' loss to the Texas Rangers on Sunday night, the Orioles are in. Oh, that result also put the Rangers and Yankees in, but late October baseball is old hat to them.The Orioles? Somehow, they  evolved into a team equipped not only to break a string of 15 straight losing campaigns, but also go toe-to-toe with the AL East beasts. They're at 92 wins and in a dead heat with the Yankees, in fact, entering the season's final three games.How? Who? Why?Good questions. Herewith, a few Orioles fun facts to chew on, so you can dazzle your friends seconds before the same words come out of Tim McCarver's mouth:Chris Davis has 31 home runs. Who? Yes, there's that question again. Davis once was a prized Texas Rangers power prospect who had trouble putting bat on ball in Arlington. Soon, he was buried on the depth chart as the Rangers became the class of the AL. But given the chance to fail in Baltimore - this will be his first season with more than 400 at-bats - he has found success, homering in five of the O's last six games. And he set the tone for Baltimore's unlikely success this season with two scoreless innings pitched in a 17-inning win at Boston. Which reminds us.The Orioles are awfully good at repurposing other teams' leftovers. Davis is one of a few erstwhile Rangers contributing, along with key set-up reliever Darren O'Day. Shortstop J.J. Hardy was acquired from Minnesota when the Twins opted to sign a middle infielder who has since forfeited $3 million to go back to Japan. Mark Reynolds still strikes out a ton, but the former Diamondback has some sock. Jason Hammel, their best pitcher most of the year, is a Rays and Rockies retread. Talk about working the edges.Nate McLouth is alive. And primed to become the first player to bat leadoff and play left field on a playoff team in the same season he was released the Pittsburgh Pirates. OK, we didn't double-check that one, but, c'mon. McLouth is somehow producing a .787 on-base plus slugging percentage after logging a .385 OPS in two months as a Pirate this year.Manny Machado is doing his hero proud. It's to be expected that a big, physical South Florida kid who plays shortstop would idolize Alex Rodriguez. Now, at 20, Machado has a chance to play in the postseason, as A-Rod did in 1996. Oh, Rodriguez hit .358 with 36 homers and finished second in MVP voting in his 20-year-old year - when Machado was 4 years old. But Machado, playing third for now, has displayed advanced instincts at his tender age, all while smacking seven homers in 181 at-bats. Things break right, he'll face his idol in the playoffs.A reliever may be their MVP. Certainly Adam Jones has the MVP-type pedigree - a .288 average, 32 homers, Gold Glove-caliber defense in center field, etc. But when a team is 28-9 in one-run games, wins 16 straight extra-inning games and its closer puts up 50 saves in 53 chances, well, it's hard to put a value on what Jim Johnson brings to the table.Buck Showalter gets to enjoy his handiwork. The Yankees, Diamondbacks and Rangers all made the World Series after he left. Now, one of baseball's sharpest minds is back in the postseason for the first time since his '95 Yankees blew a 2-0 lead to Seattle. Showalter has guided the Orioles through a maze of close shaves all season. Now, the contests only get tighter. Buckle up, indeed.

If the Angels had lost, Baltimore would have clinched its first playoff berth since 1997. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The champagne was on ice, plastic shields were in place above the cubicles in the Baltimore clubhouse and couches were removed to accommodate a celebration 15 years in the making.The party never happened.After the Orioles beat the Boston Red Sox 6-3 Sunday, around two dozen players and coaches took scoreboard watching to a new level by staying on the field at Camden Yards and rooting for the Texas Rangers to defeat the Los Angeles Angels.If the Angels had lost, Baltimore would have clinched its first playoff berth since 1997. After exchanging high-fives and fist-bumps following their fourth straight win, the Orioles gathered along the first-base line to watch the scoreboard telecast of the ninth inning, which began with Texas winning 4-3.Many in the crowd of 41,257 stood and watched, too.But a two-run double by Torii Hunter put the Angels in front and ruined the fun. As the Orioles walked off the field, manager Buck Showalter waved to the crowd and offered a fist-pump of encouragement.The Angels\' 5-4 win kept the Orioles\' magic number to clinch a wild-card berth at one. The Angels and Rangers were scheduled to wrap up the doubleheader on Sunday night, and while a loss by Los Angeles would put Baltimore in the postseason, that wouldn\'t do anything to get the champagne out of that enclosed container.Sitting in front of his locker with a beer in his hand, first baseman Mark Reynolds said, ""It would have definitely been cool to celebrate with our fans. They\'ve been supporting us all year. To be able to celebrate out there with them and take in the moment, it would have been pretty neat.""Baltimore, on the other hand, is looking to go into the postseason as AL East champions. The Orioles remain tied atop the division standings with the New York Yankees, who rallied to beat Toronto 9-6.Both contenders have three games left. New York begins a season-ending series against visiting Boston on Monday night, and the Orioles travel to Tampa Bay.Baltimore held out hope of cracking open a few cases of champagne in Florida.""I take particular enjoyment in ruining someone else\'s clubhouse,"" reliever Darren O\'Day said.Shortstop J.J. Hardy added, ""I\'m not going to say there\'s no disappointment, but we all understand we need to keep playing good baseball to get where we want to be. We\'ll just worry about ourselves and win the next three games.""Who\'d have thought the Orioles would be talking about division titles, playoff berths and champagne after 14 consecutive losing seasons and four straight last-place finishes? The Orioles (92-67) already have 23 more wins than a year ago.""Our goal now is try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden,"" Showalter said. ""Hopefully, it\'s see you later.""Hardy, Nate McLouth and Chris Davis hit solo homers, and Jim Thome drove in two runs for Baltimore. The Orioles completed a sweep and went 13-5 against Boston, their most wins in a single season versus the Red Sox since 1970 (13-5).Joe Saunders (3-3) allowed three runs, eight hits and no walks in 7 1-3 innings for Baltimore. Obtained in a late-August trade with Arizona, Saunders has yielded a total of 12 earned runs in his last six starts.Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 50th save.Cody Ross and Daniel Nava homered for the last-place Red Sox, who have dropped five straight and 16 of 22. Boston (69-90) last lost 90 games in 1966.""We haven\'t had a good season,"" manager Bobby Valentine acknowledged.Zach Stewart (0-2) gave up five runs and seven hits, including two homers, in 2 2-3 innings. In three starts this season he\'s surrendered eight home runs.After being beaten and bashed by the Orioles, who hit seven homers in the three-game series, the Red Sox now head to Yankee Stadium.A sunny, breezy fall afternoon couldn\'t have started much better for the Orioles. After the video board showed the Yankees and Angels losing early, McLouth hit the fourth pitch from Stewart over the left-field wall.""After that just trying to do damage control,"" Stewart said. ""Try to keep it at that score. Obviously I didn\'t do that.""Hardy and Davis followed with singles before Stewart hit Jones with a pitch to load the bases. After Matt Wieters bounced into a run-scoring 4-6-3 double play, Thome followed with grounder up the middle that beat the shift and rolled into the outfield, scoring Davis for a 3-0 lead.Boston wasted doubles in the second and third innings before Hardy led off the bottom of the third with his 22nd home run. Jones singled with one out, and Thome chased Stewart with an RBI single.Ross homered in the fourth to get the Red Sox to 5-1. Davis connected off Clayton Mortensen in the fifth, his 31st homer of the season and fourth in four games.Nava homered in the seventh with a man on.NOTES: Jones was chosen Orioles MVP in a vote among media covering the team, the second straight year he\'s won the award. ""It is given to me, but I think the whole team deserves it,"" he said. ... Boston hit three doubles and now has a major-league leading 214 for the season. ... Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz, who\'s 2-4 with a 5.84 ERA lifetime against the Yankees, starts Monday night against CC Sabathia.

(AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The Baltimore Orioles are tied atop the AL East with the New York Yankees with four games left, a scenario that might cause a team unaccustomed to being in a pennant race to stumble under pressure.Not these guys.After Baltimore beat the Boston Red Sox 4-3 Saturday night to earn a share of first place, Orioles first baseman Mark Reynolds described the mood of the team as ""a quiet confidence.""""Calmness,"" Reynolds said. ""We\'re playing with house money. We\'re not supposed to be here. We\'re just a bunch of kids having fun. We go out every night believing we\'re going to win the game, no matter what the situation and no matter who we\'re facing. It\'s just fun to be a part of.""Chris Davis hit his 30th home run and rookie Manny Machado lined a go-ahead shot in the seventh inning for the Orioles. After finishing in the division cellar in each of the previous four seasons, Baltimore (91-67) is tied with a team very much accustomed to finishing in first place.The Yankees lost to Toronto before this game started, so the Orioles knew they would earn a share of the lead with a win. Baltimore went ahead 3-0 in the fourth, then let Boston pull even before Machado homered, a liner into the second row of the left-field seats off Felix Doubront (11-10).Machado has been a major leaguer for all of 47 games after being summoned from Double-A Bowie on Aug. 9.""I\'m just trying to play the game,"" he said. ""Obviously, it\'s bigger than any other games I\'ve played before. I\'m just going to try and go out there and give everything I can to help this team win.""It was another tight victory for the Orioles, their trademark in this unimaginable season. Baltimore is 28-9 in one-run games and 72-0 when leading after seven innings.""It\'s an honor to sit there and watch it and marvel at what these guys can do, especially when certain things start snowballing,"" manager Buck Showalter said. ""And you create your karma. These guys have done a good job of doing that, and they\'re expecting good things to happen.""Tommy Hunter (7-8) pitched two innings, Brian Matusz and Darren O\'Day shared the eighth and Jim Johnson got three outs for his 49th save.A sellout crowd of 46,311, a majority of them clad in Oriole orange, brought Camden Yards back to a time when the home team was a force in the AL East and the ballpark was packed on a nightly basis.The fans got to cheer a Baltimore great before the first pitch, too. A statue of Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson was unveiled during a ceremony in the flag court beyond the center-field wall.The Orioles\' goal is to capture the division, but if they win two more games they are at least assured of their first trip to the playoffs since 1997 \xe2\x80\x94 their last winning season before this year. Baltimore now is 41-27 in the division and New York is 37-31, so if Baltimore wins one more game, it will have home-field advantage if there\'s a playoff to decide the AL East title.""The pressure\'s on both of us,"" Reynolds said. ""Four games left, dead heat. I guess there\'s a possibility of two playoff games. It\'s what we play for, and it\'s fun.""In addition to hitting two homers and limiting Boston to five hits, Baltimore also played well defensively. Machado, the third baseman, ranged far to his right in the fourth inning to start a double play, and Reynolds tumbled over the tarp roll and got wedged behind it after catching a foul pop. Endy Chavez, who entered as a defensive replacement in the ninth, made a sparking diving catch of a sinking liner to right field.""They just keeping doing what they have to do,"" Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine said of the Orioles. ""Buck knows what he\'s doing. He puts in a defensive replacement and he makes a diving catch. They\'ve done a great job with that young third baseman. He beat us tonight. He played excellent defense all year.""Jarrod Saltalamacchia homered for the Red Sox, who fell into last place with their 15th loss in 21 games. Boston has not finished in the cellar since 1992.Doubront allowed four runs, three earned, and seven hits in seven innings. He struck out 10, walked one and hit a batter.Red Sox leadoff hitter Jacoby Ellsbury went 1 for 4 after being sidelined since Sept. 20 with an unspecified injury. Ellsbury has only four homers and 26 RBIs after finishing second in AL MVP voting last season.""I didn\'t see him play that way this year,"" Valentine said before the game. ""He did not quite hit his stride this year.""Orioles rookie Steve Johnson took a three-hitter and a 3-2 lead into the sixth inning but was lifted after giving up a single and a walk. Hunter got Dustin Pedroia to hit a force at second, but a run came home when Cody Ross hit a sacrifice fly to right field that Davis dropped after Adam Jones drifted over from center and called for the ball. Hunter avoided further damage by getting Mauro Gomez to bounce into a double play.Baltimore went up 1-0 in the second when Machado singled in a run after Doubront hit Davis with a pitch and Reynolds reached on a slow roller to third.In the fourth, after Jones reached on a throwing error by shortstop Mike Aviles, Davis drove a 1-0 pitch far over the right-field wall for a 3-0 lead.Saltalamacchia hit his 25th homer in the fifth after Gomez drew a leadoff walk.NOTES: The Robinson statue stands alongside the team\'s five other Hall of Fame members, all of whom were in attendance: Earl Weaver, Frank Robinson, Jim Palmer, Eddie Murray and Cal Ripken Jr. ...

And they did their part with a 6-3 win over the Boston Red Sox and their Dead Manager Walking, Bobby Valentine.The champagne was chilling in the Orioles\' clubhouse. The plastic covering the lockers was in place. Even the media broke out rain gear because we dress too stylishly in our drab polos and relaxed-fit jeans to get splashed on. var adSkipCounter = 0; \xe2\x80\x9cEverything was ready to roll in here,\xe2\x80\x9d first baseman Mark Reynolds said.But ultimately the sweet spray of bubbly was put on hold because 1,300 miles away in Arlington, Texas, the Los Angeles Angels beat the Rangers in the first game of a double-header to keep their faint playoff hopes alive and keep the Orioles from celebrating just yet.Not until Sunday night, after they had left for Tampa for their final three games, would the Orioles learn they\'d finally be playing postseason baseball for the first time since 1997, helped by an 8-7 Rangers win in the nightcap that eliminated the Angels for good.What a turnaround. What a season.Enjoy it, Baltimore. It\'s a sweet moment. And you deserve it.Still, how wonderfully surreal was that scene at Camden Yards on Sunday after the Orioles 92rd win of this wild season?Right after Jim Johnson picked up his 50th save by getting the Red Sox\'s Ryan Lavarnway to bounce out to J.J. Hardy, the Orioles exchanged the usual outfield leap-and-bumps, hugs and high-fives.Then they stood as a group along the first-base line, anxiously watching the end of the Angels-Rangers game on the video scoreboard to see if the champagne would flow.Watching along with them was most of the announced crowd of 41,257, on its feet and whooping and cheering with every pitch.But when Torii Hunter lined a two-run double with two out and two on against Rangers closer Joe Nathan for a 5-4 Angels lead \xe2\x80\x94 a lead that would ultimately hold up for the win \xe2\x80\x94 a collective groan went up from the crowd.And with that, the Orioles turned and quietly filed into their dugout as Camden Yards quickly emptied.\xe2\x80\x9cI wouldn\'t say it was disappointing,\xe2\x80\x9d said sizzling right fielder Chris Davis, who went 2-for-3 and clubbed his 31st homer in the fifth for a 6-1 lead. \xe2\x80\x9cYou want to [clinch] at home in front of the fans. But at the same time, they\'re going to be happy either way, whether it\'s on the road or at home.\xe2\x80\x9cWe would have liked to win it here. I think it would have been a little more fun. But at the same time, I think they just want to see a postseason berth and a division title.\xe2\x80\x9dSo now the Orioles can concentrate on their ultimate goal, the goal manager Buck Showalter has talked about for weeks: winning the AL East title outright.They\'re tied with the Yankees at the top of the division standings after New York roared back Sunda from three runs down in the seventh inning to beat Toronto 9-6.\xe2\x80\x9cOur goal now is to try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden [Yards],\xe2\x80\x9d manager Buck Showalter said. \xe2\x80\x9cHopefully, it\'s \xe2\x80\x98See you later.\'\xe2\x80\x9dIt sure helped that the opponent Sunday was the Red Sox, who have all but mailed it in for months and seem intent on blowing up the team that collapsed late last season amid stories of clubhouse beer guzzling and chicken eating during games.Everyone knows Valentine will be fired about 10 seconds after the season ends. He looked haggard and resigned to his fate in the dugout Sunday \xe2\x80\x94 90 losses, last place in the AL East and the aggressive Boston media will do that to a manager.And look at the team the Red Sox threw out there Sunday. Aside from Dustin Pedroia, it was as no-name and unimposing a lineup as you could find.None of that, of course, was the Orioles\' concern. They were just happy to beat on the Red Sox for all three games this weekend, taking the series 13-5 and winning nine of their past 12 against them.An hour after the game, they were packed and getting ready to head to BWI Marshall Airport for the flight to Tampa before the final three games of the season against the Rays.There would be no playoff-clincher in front of the home fans. But center fielder Adam Jones was prepared to live with that.So were the rest of the Orioles.\xe2\x80\x9cI don\'t care,\xe2\x80\x9d he said about having to clinch on the road. \xe2\x80\x9cIf you\'re in, you\'re in. Nobody cares. You can clinch on the plane. We\'re going to party somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9dAnd the party would be a good one.After 14 years of losing, you could count on that.kevin.cowherd@baltsun.comtwitter.com/kevincowherdsunListen to Kevin Cowherd Tuesdays at 7:20 a.m. on 105.7 The Fan\'s ""The Norris and Davis Show.""     window._taboola = window._taboola || [];   _taboola.push({     mode: \'thumbnails-f\',     container: \'taboola-below-article-thumbnails---archives\',     placement: \'Below Article Thumbnails - Archives\',     target_type: \'mix\'   });  MORE:Whether a stent is needed can be tough callWhy expansion tank is needed\'Blushing\' ear is no cause for alarm7 Ways Michael Jackson Changed The WorldCivil War wasn\'t to end slavery Purposes: The South fought to defend slavery.

Charm and character were in. Baseball would look like baseball again.Gradually, that meant the phasing out of artificial turf, which now exists in only two stadiums. Machado, the third baseman for the Orioles, had never played on the plastic grass of Tropicana Field, and on Monday he made a critical error in a 5-3 loss to the Tampa Bay Rays. The Orioles have clinched a playoff spot, but the loss put them a game behind the Yankees in the American League East, with two to play.\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s an adjustment I need to make,\xe2\x80\x9d Machado said. \xe2\x80\x9cI should have caught more grounders in batting practice and gotten used to it more. But it\xe2\x80\x99s no excuse.\xe2\x80\x9dMachado could have learned from watching Evan Longoria, the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 third baseman, who handled two sharp, short-hop grounders off the turf in the top of the seventh inning. When Longoria led off the bottom of the seventh, with the score tied, 1-1, Machado mishandled his grounder.

They held on for the victory despite Chris Davis\xe2\x80\x99s 32nd home run, off a right-field catwalk, in the ninth inning. Three of the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 runs were unearned, resulting from Machado\xe2\x80\x99s error.

I should have made the out.\xe2\x80\x9dAs tough as he seemed to take it, Machado and his teammates cannot feel too bad. The Orioles know their season will extend past Wednesday\xe2\x80\x99s regular-season finale. They could meet the Yankees in a one-game playoff for the A.L. East, which would take place in Baltimore on Thursday, but they need help from the moribund Red Sox.

The right-hander Luis Ayala was ready, but Showalter said that if he used Ayala, Rays Manager Joe Maddon could have countered with a dangerous left-handed hitter like Matt Joyce or Luke Scott.  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  It was sound logic, but it backfired when Gimenez lashed a two-run double to the right-field corner, ending Chen\xe2\x80\x99s night. The Orioles put the tying run on base with no outs in the ninth, but they succumbed to the Rays closer Fernando Rodney, whose 0.61 earned run average is percentage points lower than Dennis Eckersley\xe2\x80\x99s in 1990 for the best average by a relief pitcher in a minimum 50 innings.

If the Angels had lost, Baltimore would have clinched its first playoff berth since 1997. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky)MoreBALTIMORE (AP) \xe2\x80\x94 The champagne was on ice, plastic shields were in place above the cubicles in the Baltimore clubhouse and couches were removed to accommodate a celebration 15 years in the making.The party never happened \xe2\x80\x94 at least not at the ballpark after the Orioles beat Boston 6-3 Sunday.Baltimore ultimately clinched its first playoff berth since 1997, but not until late Sunday when the Texas Rangers beat the Los Angeles Angels 8-7 in the finale of a day-night doubleheader.The Orioles are assured a wild-card berth, but they\'re looking to get into the postseason as AL East champions. Upon arriving in Tampa area, where the Orioles open a season-ending series at the Rays on Monday night, manager Buck Showalter said, ""I think everybody knows where the finish line is, and we\'re not there.""He added, ""There are steps to it. One is assuring yourself of getting a chair at the dance. And then we\'d like to figure out a way to play some games at our park in front of our fans. It\'s in our court.""The Orioles remained tied atop the division standings with the New York Yankees, who rallied to beat Toronto 9-6 and also clinched no worse than a wild-card berth.Both contenders have three games left. New York begins a season-ending series against visiting Boston on Monday night, and the Orioles face the Rays.""We\'ll see where the next three games take us,"" Showalter said.After the final out of their win over the Red Sox, around two dozen players and coaches took scoreboard watching to a new level by staying on the field at Camden Yards and rooting for the Rangers to win the opener,Orioles players exchanged high-fives and fist-bumps following their fourth straight victory, then gathered along the first-base line to watch the scoreboard telecast of the ninth inning, which began with Texas winning 4-3.Many in the crowd of 41,257 stood and watched, too.But a two-out, two-run double by Torii Hunter put the Angels in front and ruined the fun. As the Orioles walked off the field, Showalter waved to the crowd and offered a fist-pump of encouragement.Sitting in front of his locker with a beer in his hand, first baseman Mark Reynolds said, ""It would have definitely been cool to celebrate with our fans. They\'ve been supporting us all year. To be able to celebrate out there with them and take in the moment, it would have been pretty neat.""Baltimore held out hope of cracking open a few cases of champagne in Florida.""I take particular enjoyment in ruining someone else\'s clubhouse,"" reliever Darren O\'Day said.Shortstop J.J. Hardy added, ""I\'m not going to say there\'s no disappointment, but we all understand we need to keep playing good baseball to get where we want to be. We\'ll just worry about ourselves and win the next three games.""Who\'d have thought the Orioles would be talking about division titles, playoff berths and champagne after 14 consecutive losing seasons and four straight last-place finishes? The Orioles (92-67) already have 23 more wins than a year ago.""Our goal now is try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden,"" Showalter said. ""Hopefully, it\'s see you later.""Hardy, Nate McLouth and Chris Davis hit solo homers, and Jim Thome drove in two runs for Baltimore. The Orioles completed a sweep and went 13-5 against Boston, their most wins in a single season versus the Red Sox since 1970 (13-5).Joe Saunders (3-3) allowed three runs, eight hits and no walks in 7 1-3 innings for Baltimore. Obtained in a late-August trade with Arizona, Saunders has yielded a total of 12 earned runs in his last six starts.Jim Johnson worked the ninth for his 50th save.Cody Ross and Daniel Nava homered for the last-place Red Sox, who have dropped five straight and 16 of 22. Boston (69-90) last lost 90 games in 1966.""We haven\'t had a good season,"" manager Bobby Valentine acknowledged.Zach Stewart (0-2) gave up five runs and seven hits, including two homers, in 2 2-3 innings. In three starts this season he\'s surrendered eight home runs.After being beaten and bashed by the Orioles, who hit seven homers in the three-game series, the Red Sox now head to Yankee Stadium.A sunny, breezy fall afternoon couldn\'t have started much better for the Orioles. After the video board showed the Yankees and Angels losing early, McLouth hit the fourth pitch from Stewart over the left-field wall.""After that just trying to do damage control,"" Stewart said. ""Try to keep it at that score. Obviously I didn\'t do that.""Hardy and Davis followed with singles before Stewart hit Jones with a pitch to load the bases. After Matt Wieters bounced into a run-scoring 4-6-3 double play, Thome followed with grounder up the middle that beat the shift and rolled into the outfield, scoring Davis for a 3-0 lead.Boston wasted doubles in the second and third innings before Hardy led off the bottom of the third with his 22nd home run. Jones singled with one out, and Thome chased Stewart with an RBI single.Ross homered in the fourth to get the Red Sox to 5-1. Davis connected off Clayton Mortensen in the fifth, his 31st homer of the season and fourth in four games.Nava homered in the seventh with a man on.NOTES: Jones was chosen Orioles MVP in a vote among media covering the team, the second straight year he\'s won the award. ""It is given to me, but I think the whole team deserves it,"" he said. ... Boston hit three doubles and now has a major-league leading 214 for the season. ... Red Sox RHP Clay Buchholz, who\'s 2-4 with a 5.84 ERA lifetime against the Yankees, starts Monday night against CC Sabathia. Rookie Wei-Yin Chen (12-10) starts for Baltimore in Tampa Bay against Alex Cobb (10-9). ...

', 'www.yahoo.com'), ('Orioles win, clinch playoff berth - yahoo.com', 'BALTIMORE -- Orioles manager Buck Showalter said he\'s challenged his team to always stay together. They\'ve done that throughout the season and did so once more in an interesting way Sunday afternoon.  Moments after the Orioles defeated Boston 6-3 the team came out on to the field at Camden Yards to watch the ninth inning of the Los Angeles-Texas game on the big video board in center field. The Rangers were one out away from winning, which would have clinched Baltimore\'s playoff spot, but Torii Hunter\'s two-run double in that ninth inning gave Los Angeles the win in the first game of that doubleheader.  The crowd of 41,257 at Camden Yards gave a collective sad sigh after Hunter\'s hit, and the Orioles then turned to walk into their first-base dugout - buoyed by a huge ovation from the fans.  ""There are so many things here that can separate you,"" Showalter said. ""Let the game, the competition, be the only thing that challenges you. I\'m real proud of them.""  This victory over Boston completed a sweep of the three-game weekend series and reduced Baltimore\'s magic number to one for clinching a playoff spot. But that number went to zero, and the Orioles wound up clinching a playoff spot later Sunday night when Texas bounced back to beat the Angels 8-7 in the nightcap of their split doubleheader.  In addition, the Orioles (92-67) stayed tied for first place with the Yankees (92-67) in the American League East after New York rallied for a 9-6 victory over the Jays in Toronto on Sunday.  Both Baltimore and the Yankees have three games remaining, and they\'re each also one game ahead of Oakland for the top spot in the wild-card race. The A\'s beat Seattle on Sunday. Whoever wins the top wild-card spot would host a one-game playoff, now scheduled for Friday.  The Orioles head to Tampa Bay to end their season with the Rays, while the Yankees host Boston (69-90) to close their regular season. This is the first time Baltimore has made the playoffs since 1997.  Several Oriole players said afterward they would have loved to clinch the playoff spot at home with the crowd watching like it was Sunday afternoon. But in the end, they just wanted to clinch in some form or another.  ""I don\'t care - who cares?"" said Orioles center fielder Adam Jones when asked about where he\'d like to clinch. ""You\'re in, you\'re in. I don\'t care. Nobody cares. We can do it at home or we can do it on the plane. We are going to party somewhere.""  Jones made his comments before the Angels lost the second game of the doubleheader, so presumably the Orioles will celebrate on the plane.  The Orioles have been taking a let\'s-just-take-care-of business approach and trying to keep the emotions down throughout the last several days. But on Sunday, after coming so close to clinching it, some of those emotions and smiles were leaking out.  ""We\'re close, we\'re right there,"" closer Jim Johnson, who earned his 50th save, said immediately after the Orioles\' victory. ""We\'re smelling it and obviously want to finish it off. We\'ll get it done. That\'s our mind-set.""  And what a difference a year makes. Just one year ago, the Orioles played the ultimate spoiler role, knocking Boston out of the 2011 playoffs and opening the door for Tampa Bay.  The Red Sox couldn\'t do much this weekend in their role of spoilers as they looked flat in all three games, and the Orioles outscored them, 19-7.  ""They had a losing culture here,"" Boston manager Bobby Valentine said. ""It looks like they\'ve turned that around. They\'re playing with a good feel.""  On Sunday, they used the combination that\'s served them well all season - good pitching, defense and power hitting. Joe Saunders (3-3) threw 7 1/3 solid innings, and Baltimore got solo homers from Nate McLouth, J.J. Hardy and Chris Davis en route to the win.  Saunders came up big for the Orioles. He gave up a two-run homer to Daniel Nava, a solo shot to Cody Ross but nothing else and scattered eight hits over his 7 1/3-inning effort.  ""I\'m very humbled to get the opportunity to do this,"" Saunders said. ""To be able to come out and get a victory for the ball club was pretty special. It was awesome.""  The offense gave Saunders a huge lift with three runs in the first en route to an early 5-0 lead as Boston never really challenged. Showalter pulled Saunders in the eighth, earning the left-hander a huge ovation, and Darren O\'Day came on to finish the inning .Johnson came on in the ninth to close it.  The Orioles removed most of the suspense early, scoring three runs on four hits in the bottom of the first off Boston starter Zach Stewart (0-2). McLouth led off with a homer to left-center on Stewart\'s fourth pitch to put the Orioles up, 1-0.  Hardy and Davis followed with singles before Stewart hit Jones to load the bases. Matt Wieters grounded into a double play, but Hardy scored the second run.  Boston then went into a shift against Jim Thome, a left-handed pull hitter. But Thome crossed the Red Sox up for the second time in the series by rolling a single to left field to make it 3-0.  Hardy struck again in the third, as his lead-off homer to left put the Orioles in front 4-0. The Orioles added another run later in the inning on Thome\'s second RBI single, which ended Stewart\'s day.  Stewart wound up allowing five runs on seven hits in those 2 2/3 innings. He\'s made three starts for the Red Sox this year, and opponents have scored 20 runs on 26 hits in just 11 1/3 innings.  Ross put Boston on the board with his solo homer off Saunders to start the fourth, cutting Baltimore\'s lead to 5-1. Danny Valencia got a one-out single moments later, but Ryan Lavarnway grounded into an inning-ending double play.  Boston cut the lead to 6-3 in the seventh when Nava hit his two-run homer off Saunders, but the Red Sox couldn\'t do anything else as Baltimore completed the series sweep.  That\'s when the Orioles came out on to the field to watch the Rangers unsuccessfully try and finish off the Angels. But no matter, Showalter said that even though this was the last regular-season home game, the Orioles want to be back.  ""Our goal now is to try to figure out a way to play some more baseball games here at Camden [Yards],"" Showalter said.  And the Rangers helped the Orioles take another step toward that goal.  NOTES: Orioles closer Johnson became the 10th pitcher to reach 50 saves in a season since the save became an official baseball statistic in 1969. Johnson had already set an Orioles record -- breaking the old one of 45 that Randy Myers set in 1997 -- and made the All-Star team back in July...Jones was presented with the Most Valuable Oriole Award before Sunday\'s game. Jones also won the honor in 2011, an award voted on by the media that cover the Orioles on a regular basis. Jones also made the All-Star team earlier this season...Ross has been on a roll against left-handed pitchers recently. After the fourth-inning homer against Saunders, 11 of his last 31 hits versus the lefties have been homers...The Red Sox finished with a 5-13 record against the Orioles this season. The last time Boston lost at least 12 games to Baltimore in one season came in 1970, when the Orioles held a 13-5 edge en route to their World Series title that year. ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

But his mind was not really there. In spirit, Davis was more than a thousand miles away, engrossed in the Yankees\xe2\x80\x99 game playing on the television hanging from the ceiling in the center of the room. Davis, the Baltimore Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 right fielder, trained his eyes on the screen, over the heads of the reporters. A first-place tie was just three outs away.Davis finished his interviews and moved closer to the television, just as Raul Ibanez lined a game-tying, ninth-inning homer into the right-field seats. Groans rang from all corners of the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 clubhouse, and creative expletives went flying. But Davis could only sigh. Ibanez, a gentleman of the game, could not draw his ire.\xe2\x80\x9cWhy does he have to be a good guy, too?\xe2\x80\x9d Davis said.As the room cleared out, the Orioles headed for their team hotel knowing only that their 1-0 victory over the Tampa Bay Rays assured that they could not be eliminated from the American League East race. Only later, after Ibanez\xe2\x80\x99s game-winning single in the 12th, would they learn that they remained a game behind the Yankees.The Orioles will start Chris Tillman on Wednesday and hope he can match the kind of pitching they got on Tuesday. The Orioles, who have clinched at least a wild card, took the best from the Rays\xe2\x80\x99 James Shields \xe2\x80\x94 who set a club record with 15 strikeouts and allowed only two base runners \xe2\x80\x94 and came out a winner thanks to one mighty swing.

PETERSBURG, Fla. \xe2\x80\x93 One year ago, almost to the day, the Baltimore Orioles made baseball magic possible in this town. They played their hearts out on the final day of the season against the Boston Red Sox \xe2\x80\x93 a game that was meaningless to them in the standings. In doing so, they allowed the Tampa Bay Rays a fighting chance to win the wild card and make the playoffs.One year later, the Orioles arrived here with a chance to win the AL East. Another week of October magic was possible. All Baltimore needed was a good series against the Rays and a little help from the Red Sox.View photosAnd up in New York, Boston manager Bobby Valentine trotted out a lineup of no-names and minor league call-ups to face CC Sabathia.How fitting.You would think the Sox, of all teams, would show up in force against the hated Yankees. You would think Boston would relish the chance to rob New York of a division title. You would think just maybe there would be some pride left in a beaten baseball town.Apparently, you would be wrong. It was 9-0 Yankees after two innings. So much for scoreboard watching. The game ended 10-2. The Orioles fell to the Rays, 5-3, to fall a game back to the Yankees with two to play in the regular season.That\'s how far the Red Sox have fallen in just one year. Who crumbles in front of their hated rivals, under any circumstances? The Sox took a lot of the air out of the season, so of course they had to take the air out of the last week.They should have been the perfect foil for the Yankees at this moment. They should have given the last week of this season the spice it needs to rival the impossible finish from last year.Nope.[Related:  Nationals fans go wild after clinching NL East]Granted, Jacoby Ellsbury and Dustin Pedroia are dealing with injuries. And Valentine says Ellsbury will play Tuesday. When asked if they were bothered by the Red Sox\'s lineup, the Orioles either bristled \xe2\x80\x93 ""Come on,"" manager Buck Showalter said \xe2\x80\x93 or shrugged \xe2\x80\x93 ""We lost; can\'t control the Yankees,"" said Adam Jones. But two hitters in the Red Sox lineup were opening day starters, and the entire batting order earns a combined $13 million, according to the Boston Herald. Hardly a major league team there. And they gave the Yankees hardly a game.View photosIt\'s a fitting ending to one of the most embarrassing seasons in recent major league history. The Orioles and Rays, whose combined team salaries roughly match the Sox, have won in spite of themselves. The Red Sox, meanwhile, have lost in a torrent of spite. They\'ve dropped 10 of their last 11 and 91 overall. They are a shell of themselves. And Monday, there were literally a shell of themselves.There\'s no ""deserve"" in baseball, of course. The Orioles don\'t ""deserve"" a 2004 Red Sox effort any more than the Rays ""deserve"" a world-class ballpark. There are haves and have-nots in baseball. The Red Sox are the haves, even though they clearly have not.[Related: Yahoo! Sports Fan Shop: Buy Baltimore Orioles playoffs merchandiseIt\'s a shame they couldn\'t have made this week more interesting. There was so much drama last year and now it looks like the Orioles will be fighting to host a play-in game on Friday.

Even the Cleveland Indians, the lowly Indians, fought to derail the Chicago White Sox last week. The last-place Minnesota Twins put up a fight against the Detroit Tigers.Maybe it wouldn\'t have mattered. Maybe the Yankees, so motivated to win this thing, would have cruised to victory over any Red Sox team.

Like a baby.""The Rays won for the 11th time in 12 games, a stretch that\'s kept them in contention for the AL\'s second wild-card.They began the night trailing Oakland by three games and must sweep the Orioles and hope the A\'s drop three straight to Texas to remain alive.Baltimore already is assured of being in the playoffs for the first time in 15 years, but still has its sights on outlasting the Yankees for the AL East title. The Orioles fell a game out of first place behind New York when the Yankees beat Boston.""We\'ve played 12 playoff games and we\'ve won 11 of them,"" said Maddon, whose team has outscored opponents 80-31 during the surge. "" But we do need help, there\'s no question about that. Again, regardless, I just love the way our guys are going about their business.""Alex Cobb allowed two hits over seven innings, Ben Zobrist hit his 20th homer and Chris Giminez had a two-run double off Wei-Yin Chen as the Rays pulled away from a 1-1 tie in the seventh.Cobb (11-9) yielded a fourth-inning single to J.J. Hardy and an opposite-field solo homer to Matt Wieters that had tied it in the top of the seventh.Chris Davis homered for the fifth straight game for Baltimore, a two-run shot off Kyle Farnsworth that trimmed Baltimore\'s deficit to 5-3 in the ninth.Fernando Rodney gave up singles to Adam Jones and Wieters to put the potential tying runs on base. The Rays closer struck out Jim Thome and Mark Reynolds before getting Endy Chavez to hit a grounder back to mound to end the game. It was Rodney\'s 47th save in 49 opportunities.""We didn\'t take care of our business. We lost,"" Jones said. ""When it comes to the Yankees, we can\'t control them. We can\'t control if they win or lose.""The Orioles arrived in St. Petersburg for the season-ending series later than expected Sunday night after their plane had to divert to Jacksonville because of a fire in the galley.They officially clinched at least a wild-card berth when the Los Angeles Angels lost the second game of a doubleheader to the Texas Rangers late Sunday, and manager Buck Showalter, coaches and players celebrated by having a short meeting and toasting the accomplishment at the team hotel.""We\'ve clinched a spot, but we\'ve got an opportunity to win the East. That\'s big,"" Jones said before the game. ""You get to put up a banner at Camden Yards. It speaks something about the team. It means you finished ahead of the Yankees and Boston and Tampa Bay, everybody.""Cobb retired 10 in a row before Hardy singled between shortstop and third base for Baltimore\'s first hit. The 24-year-old right-hander walked Jim Thome with one out in the fifth and Nate McLouth with one out in the sixth. McLouth stole second, but was stranded when J.J. Hardy grounded to shortstop and Chris Davis took a third called strike.Wieters\' career-high 23rd homer home run cleared the short wall in the left-field corner known as 162 Landing, the spot where Evan Longoria hit the 12th-inning homer that the sent the Rays to the playoffs on the final night of last season.""It is frustrating when it\'s out of your hands, but we put ourselves in that position. We could have held our own destiny,"" Cobb said. ""Even coming into the last road trip we had that chance, but we let a couple slip that we wish we could have had back, but we\'re doing all we can now with what we have.""While Maddon is hoping for another dramatic finish, the manager said he won\'t fret if the Rays fall short of earning their fourth berth in five seasons.""Honestly, it just is what it is. We had opportunities early in the year to win more games, and we did not. But so did everybody else,"" Maddon said.""Everybody else is going to be bemoaning the same points if they don\'t get there at this juncture. So for me, it\'s about staying right here, keeping the blinders on. It\'s about moving it forward, organizationally speaking. We\'ve stil got a heartbeat. Let\'s see what happens. I expect to come out (Tuesday) with another game that means something.""NOTES: Chen, who\'s 0-4 over seven starts since last winning on Aug. 19, hasn\'t won since Aug. 19, allowed four runs \xe2\x80\x94 three of them unearned \xe2\x80\x94 and six hits in 6 2-3 innings. ... Zobrist joined B.J. Upton as the only Rays with at least 20 homers. He has driven in 21 runs in 28 games since the start of September. ... Baltimore RHP Jason Hammel (sore right knee) threw five innings in the Florida instructional league and could be available to pitch for the Orioles late this week. ... Orioles RF Nick Markakis (broken left thumb) will have surgically-inserted pins removed in a week. ', 'www.yahoo.com')]"

PETERSBURG, Fla.For more than a month, the Baltimore Orioles put a scare into the Yankees. They succeeded in filling the end of the regular season with tension, making it seem as if the playoffs had already started.In the end, though, the Orioles never did overtake the Yankees for first place in the American League East \xe2\x80\x94 not for a single day. They pulled even for 10 days, sprinkled all through September, and came here that way on Sunday night. They left here on Wednesday two games back, after dropping two of three to the Tampa Bay Rays, who got three homers from Evan Longoria in a 4-1 victory in the regular-season finale.The Orioles now head to Texas for the wild-card game against the Rangers on Friday. Had they beaten the Rays on Wednesday, the game would have taken place at Camden Yards.\xe2\x80\x9cThere\xe2\x80\x99s a little bit of disappointment,\xe2\x80\x9d said right fielder Chris Davis, a former Ranger whose streak of six games with a homer ended on Wednesday. \xe2\x80\x9cBut at the same time, you can\xe2\x80\x99t hang your head. You have to be proud of what you accomplished this season, and you\xe2\x80\x99ve got to be ready to go to Texas and play nine innings.\xe2\x80\x9d  Advertisement  Continue reading the main story  The Orioles knew they would face a much tougher opponent than they had last weekend, when they swept the free-falling Red Sox at home.

It\xe2\x80\x99s a tough road, however you do it. We feel real good about the opportunity we have earned.\xe2\x80\x9dThe Orioles will face Yu Darvish, the Rangers\xe2\x80\x99 All-Star right-hander, on Friday, but they have not named their own starter. Showalter said it could be the veteran left-hander Joe Saunders, who is 3-3 with a 3.67 E.R.A. in seven starts since a trade from Arizona, or the rookie Steve Johnson, who is 4-0 with a 2.11 earned run average in 12 games (four starts) this season.

In that way, said the Orioles\xe2\x80\x99 Adam Jones, the new playoff format is no different than the old one, at least in the American League. Had they finished with identical records last season, the teams would have still had to play a tiebreaker game for the right to advance to the division series.

The coronation, however, was delayed much longer than anyone could have predicted.Their commanding advantage dissolved to nothing on Sept. 4, and the Yankees were forced to play a month\xe2\x80\x99s worth of tense, playofflike games to avoid the embarrassment of blowing such a large lead to the upstart Baltimore Orioles.They never relented, but neither did the Orioles, and it took until the final day of the regular season for the Yankees to clinch the title, their 13th in the last 17 years. After so much extended tension, they exploded with a resounding 14-2 victory over the hapless Boston Red Sox that felt more like a victory parade than a competitive game.In fact, the decisive moment came even before their game ended. It arrived in lights on the center-field scoreboard during Alex Rodriguez\xe2\x80\x99s at-bat in the seventh inning, showing that Tampa Bay Ray had defeated the Orioles, 4-1.

Their late-season flourish with 16 wins in their final 21 games gave them the best record in the league (95-67) and a No. 1 seed, ensuring they will play the winner of Friday\xe2\x80\x99s one-game wild-card playoff between the Texas Rangers and the Orioles.The winner of that game will host the Yankees in the first two games of the best-of-five divisional series starting Sunday. If the Yankees win that series, they will have home-field advantage in the A.L. Championship Series.

Cano hit a pair of two-run homers Wednesday and knocked in a career-high-tying six runs to lead the march. He had four hits to record his ninth straight multihit game and was asked what he would think if he saw a hitter doing what he was doing.

The four home runs gave the Yankees 245 for the season, a franchise record that eclipsed the mark of 244 set in 2009, the year they won their last World Series.Hiroki Kuroda, who pitched and won the home opener at the Stadium on April 13, bookended a fine first season with the Yankees by winning his 16th game. He pitched seven innings and allowed two runs and seven hits and easily outshined Matsuzaka in a duel of Japanese pitchers.

(AP Photo/Chris O'Meara)MoreST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Another one-run victory by the Baltimore Orioles pushed the AL East race to the final day of the season.Chris Davis homered for the sixth straight game and the Orioles overcame a club-record 15 strikeouts by Tampa Bay pitcher James Shields to beat the Rays 1-0 Tuesday night.Baltimore remained one game behind the first-place New York Yankees, who rallied late to beat Boston 4-3 in 12 innings. The Orioles, already assured a playoff spot, need a victory Wednesday and a Yankees loss to force a one-game tiebreaker for the division title Thursday at Camden Yards.''We're not supposed to be here. So just go out and have fun and see what happens,'' closer Jim Johnson said after the Orioles improved to 29-9 in one-run games.''You have to win those games,'' he added. ''If you're able to keep it close, you just try to find a way.''Orioles rookie Miguel Gonzalez (9-4) limited the Rays to two singles over 6 1-3 innings. The right-hander walked two and struck out seven before manager Buck Showalter turned the game over to the bullpen.Davis joined Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson as the only Baltimore players to homer in six consecutive games, connecting off Shields (15-10) in the fourth. The Orioles managed only one other hit - Nate McLouth's sixth-inning single - in Shields' 19th career complete game and third this season.''He made one mistake, and fortunately Chris was on it,'' Baltimore manager Buck Showalter said.The Rays have lost 1-0 five times since Aug. 5 - twice to the Orioles.''I hung a changeup. He's a pretty good hitter. I think that was probably the farthest home run I've ever given up in my career,'' Shields said. ''I sent the bat boy over and told him to tell him, 'Can you hit it any farther?' Just joking around a little bit. He said something like, 'I'm sorry. I'll go and try and hit it 480 feet next time.' I thought that was pretty funny.''The Orioles, guaranteed at least a wild-card spot, clinched their first playoff berth in 15 years late Sunday.The Rays won the opener of the three-game series Monday night to extend a late surge that kept them in contention for the second AL wild card, but they were eliminated from postseason contention when the Oakland Athletics beat Texas a few hours later to assure themselves at least a wild card.Brian Matusz replaced Gonzalez after the starter struck out Jeff Keppinger to begin the seventh. Darren O'Day worked the eighth for the Orioles, and Johnson finished the two-hitter for his major league-leading 51st save.Gonzalez pitched seven scoreless innings in his only previous start at Tropicana Field on Aug. 5, but was not involved in the decision in a game the Orioles won 1-0 in 10 innings. He limited the Rays to two hits and four walks in that outing and was even tougher on them this time.Evan Longoria singled leading off the second against the right-hander. B.J. Upton drew a leadoff walk in the fourth and was stranded at second when Longoria flied out and Keppinger struck out. Chris Gimenez opened the sixth with Tampa Bay's second hit, and Gonzalez walked Ben Zobrist with two outs before fanning Longoria to end the threat.Shields was just as impressive, retiring 11 in a row before giving up Davis' 33rd homer. The right-hander whiffed seven of the last nine batters he faced to finish with a flourish.''I knew this was my last game and I wanted to let it all hang out. I wanted to end on a good note, end on a bang,'' Shields said. ''That was probably the best game of my career.''Davis homered over the center-field wall on a 1-1 changeup with two outs in the fourth. Jackson homered in six straight games for the Orioles in July 1976.''It kind of blows my mind to even be mentioned in the same breath as Reggie, but it's more about the win than anything else,'' Davis said. ''I'm kind of glad to be the guy that's coming through in this situation, but as long as we get the win I don't care.''NOTES: All-Star closer Fernando Rodney was selected as the Rays' team MVP in a vote of local baseball writers covering the team. If the right-hander doesn't give up an earned run in Wednesday night's season finale, he will set a major league record for the lowest ERA by a relief pitcher working a minimum of 50 innings. Rodney got his 47th save Monday, lowering his ERA to 0.6053 in 74 1-3 innings. Dennis Eckersley set the record of 0.6136 for Oakland in 1990. ... Rays pitchers have struck out 10 or more batters in a game 60 times this season. ... Orioles RHP Jason Hammel, who threw a bullpen session Monday, is no longer restricted by his knee injury and is an option for the Orioles in the postseason, Showalter said. ... RHP Kevin Gausman, Baltimore's first-round draft pick out of LSU, visited the team and said he hopes to pitch in the big leagues next year. ''That's one of my goals, but it's not up to me,'' the 21-year-old said. "", 'www.yahoo.com')]"
