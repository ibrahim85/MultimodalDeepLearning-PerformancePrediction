Postgame conference with Orioles manager Buck Showalter after the O's beat the Red Sox, 2-0. (Ulysses Muñoz / Baltimore Sun) Postgame conference with Orioles manager Buck Showalter after the O's beat the Red Sox, 2-0. (Ulysses Muñoz / Baltimore Sun) The Orioles beat the Red Sox, 2-0 on Friday, April 21. (Ulysses Muñoz / Baltimore Sun) The Orioles beat the Red Sox, 2-0 on Friday, April 21. (Ulysses Muñoz / Baltimore Sun) Orioles (2-0) vs. Yankees (1-2) Where: Camden Yards First pitch: 7:05 p.m. TV/Radio: MASN2/105.7 FM Starting pitchers: Orioles RHP Ubaldo Jimenez (2016: 8-12, 5.44 ERA) vs. Yankees RHP Luis Severino (2016: 3-8, 5.83 ERA) What to watch 1. Blue pinstripes. The Yankees are coming off a rough series loss to the Tampa Bay Rays, having been held to nine runs through three games with all the young guns struggling. Gary Sanchez, Aaron Judge, Greg Bird and Ronald Torreyes have combined for five hits in 47 at-bats (.107). The Orioles' job will be to keep their bats quiet. 2. Which Ubaldo. Ubaldo Jimenez makes his first start of the season after a rough spring (0-3, 5.94 ERA in five starts). Dylan Bundy was able to shrug off spring struggles in a big way Wednesday. Can Jimenez do the same? He begins the final season of his contract looking to put inconsistency and long ineffective stretches behind him. It will be worth watching whether that begins tonight. 3. Hottest Oriole. Forty miles south at Nationals Park, Matt Wieters has gotten off to a scorching start with his new team. His replacement in Baltimore hasn't been too shabby either. It could be argued that Welington Castillo is the hottest Orioles hitter throught two games, batting .429/.429/.571 with a double. Can he keep that up against the Yankees?

Hardy Game Snapshot  Toronto Blue Jays                 vs. Baltimore Orioles  Monday, April 3, 2017 at 3:05pm Written by Big B on March 31, 2017 Toronto Blue Jays vs. Baltimore Orioles MLB Baseball:  Monday, April 3rd, 3:05 pm EST Marco Estrada (0-0) vs. Kevin Gausman Line:  Toronto/Baltimore -110 The Blue Jays and Orioles get their season off to a start on Monday with an afternoon noon game in Baltimore.  Both teams finished last year 89-73 and were the two wild card teams from the American League.  The Blue Jays beat the Orioles in the one game playoff, and then went on to beat the Texas Rangers before losing to the Cleveland Indians in the American League Championship series. As well as both teams played last year, neither team is given a great chance of winning the AL East this year.  The Red Sox are the big favorites at -160 and the Yankees are a surprise second choice.  Coming in as the third favorite are the Blue Jays at 6-1, while the Orioles are fourth favorite at 7.5-1.  Pretty good odds if you fancy either of these teams to surprise in the AL East this year. The Blue Jays are known for their fierce batting lineup, but they actually have a very solid starting pitching rotation this year.  That’s why I was slightly surprised that Marco Estrada got the call for their opening game.  Estrada was solid last year, going 9-9 with a 3.48 ERA, but there are really three other starters that I think deserve the opening start for the Blue Jays. Offensively, the Blue Jays are still a lot for any pitcher to handle.  While they lost Edwin Encarnacion to the Indians, they still have Jose Bautista and Josh Donaldson to carry the lineup.  Troy Tulowitzki has been solid since coming over from the Rockies, but hasn’t had a break out year.  Maybe this is the year for him. Kevin Gausman gets the nod for manager Buck Showalter on opening day for the Orioles.  He is coming off a year in which he went only 9-12 but had a very respectable ERA of 3.61.  He is only 23-31 and I can’t imagine there’s many other opening game starters who are eight games under .500 in their career.  Still, Gausman is only 26 and looks to be getting better each year. Offensively, the Orioles will likely be carried by Manny Machado and Mark Trumbo.  Machado hit .294 last year and had 188 hits.  He’s also a stud on the defensive side of the ball.  Trumbo is one of the best long ball hitters in the game these days. He finished 2016 with 47 home runs and 108 RBI’s. Trends: The Toronto Blue Jays are: The Baltimore Orioles are: These trends date back to last year, but there are still two impressive ones in the Orioles favor.  They are a remarkable 44-20 in their last 64 at home against a right handed starter.  Also, Kevin Gausman went 7-1 in his last eight home starts of last year.  I like both of those trends and I’ll take Baltimore on Monday.

Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports Over the past two months, the Baltimore Orioles and the rest of the league have been critiqued by prominent baseball writers and experts as major sports media outlets release their MLB season previews and predictions.Despite coming off a playoff season in 2016 with one of the most powerful offenses and commanding bullpens in baseball, the Orioles, once again, are projected to suffer a losing season in 2017 and finish towards the depths of the AL East.The following predictions, rankings, and picks will come from various major sports media outlets and baseball writers.Be sure to leave your thoughts in the comments!USA Today Sports’ 2017 MLB projectionsLast year, USA Today Sports’ “semi-scientific” MLB projections forecasted the Baltimore Orioles to finish with the worst record in the American League East at 78-84.How we see the 2016 MLB season unfolding: https://t.co/czCLqtzB4I pic.twitter.com/UL8YC82mw1— USA TODAY Sports (@USATODAYsports) February 15, 2016Gabe Lacques, who was credited as the author in USA Today Sports’ 2017 MLB predictions, used the entire seven paragraph opening to explain all the possibilities of how their dramatic MLB projections may (probably) will be altered.Towards the end of Lacques’ piece, he reflected on the Baltimore Orioles stating:And fret not if your team is on the wrong side of the playoff line – it doesn’t mean everybody hates you.

First, according to Baseball Prospectus’ glossary, PECOTA stands for Player Empirical Comparison and Optimization Test Algorithm.In further detail, PECOTA, created by Nate Silver, serves as Baseball Prospectus’ exclusive sabermetric system that projects the performance of MLB players based on historical baseball data.It’s not a secret that PECOTA and the Orioles aren’t the best of friends as the baseball projection system continually projects the Orioles to finish at the bottom of the AL East and 2017 is no different. This year, PECOTA projects (guesses) the Orioles to win 73 games, a 16-game decline in wins from last season.*Baseball Prospectus PECOTA: 73-89, fifth in AL EastBleacher Report’s 2017 MLB PredictionsThe day after Super Bowl 51, the great people at Bleacher Report released their 2017 MLB Predictions in celebration of the start of baseball season.Unlike PECOTA, Bleacher Report sides with the folks at USA Today Sports on Orioles finishing the 2017 season with a winning record. B/R forecasts the Orioles to win six fewer games than last season with a record of 83-79, third place in the AL East behind the projected first place Boston Red Sox (97-65) and second place Toronto Blue Jays (86-76).In what seems to be the common question for the Orioles every offseason, Bleacher Report questions the O’s ability to win games with a rotation that carries Ubaldo Jimenez and Wade Miley.Despite the lack of reliable arms in the O’s rotation, B/R proclaims last year’s league leading 253 total home runs by the O’s will be back in action in 2017, especially with the re-signing of reigning home run king Mark Trumbo.The Orioles featured power hitters Adam Jones, Manny Machado, Chris Davis, and Trumbo all had a slugging percentage above the .417 league average in 2016.Source: FanGraphs — Adam Jones, Mark Trumbo, Chris Davis*Bleacher Report: 83-79, third in AL EastFangraphs’ 2017 projected standingsFangraphs, a sabermetric site similar to PECOTA, uses a method constructed and operated by Jared Cross, Dash Davidson, and Peter Rosenbloom called Steamer projections to build their 2017 MLB predictions.

For CBS Sports, I elected to review Matt Snyder’s over/under bets for the 2017 season.The sportsbook from the Atlantis Casino in the city of Reno, Nevada has set the over/under for wins at 84.5 for the Baltimore Orioles. The early AL East favorite Boston Red Sox lead the division with an over/under at 90.5, followed by the Blue Jays at 86.5 wins.Now to Snyder’s over/under picks, who picked five teams for the over, followed up by five teams for the under. Surprisingly, at least for me at least, Snyder’s first over pick is the Baltimore Orioles. Snyder opened his Orioles discussion by saying:Call this a course correction. I routinely have under-estimated the Orioles under Buck Showalter and they have exceeded expectations in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. Even in a “down” 2015, they went 81-81.Even though Snyder didn’t reveal his prediction on how many wins the Orioles capture in 2017, but he did mention that he doesn’t believe the Orioles will get 90 wins.*CBS Sports’ Matt Snyder’s over/under for wins: Over 84.5 winsCall to the Pen’s 2017 MLB Playoff PredictionsJason Reed from FanSided’s Call to the Pen revealed his 2017 MLB playoff predictions back in December.

Lastly, the home run champ from 2016 is forecasted to knock 32 baseballs out of the park.Despite four players projected to hit 28 home runs or more, Fangraphs doesn’t forecast one Oriole to hit above .294 this upcoming season. With the exception of Chris Davis and Seth Smith, every player in the projected starting lineup hit above last year’s league average of .255 batting average.Source: FanGraphs — Welington Castillo, J.J.

For CBS Sports, I elected to review Matt Snyder’s over/under bets for the 2017 season.The sportsbook from the Atlantis Casino in the city of Reno, Nevada has set the over/under for wins at 84.5 for the Baltimore Orioles. The early AL East favorite Boston Red Sox lead the division with an over/under at 90.5, followed by the Blue Jays at 86.5 wins.Now to Snyder’s over/under picks, who picked five teams for the over, followed up by five teams for the under. Surprisingly, at least for me at least, Snyder’s first over pick is the Baltimore Orioles. Snyder opened his Orioles discussion by saying:Call this a course correction. I routinely have under-estimated the Orioles under Buck Showalter and they have exceeded expectations in 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. Even in a “down” 2015, they went 81-81.Even though Snyder didn’t reveal his prediction on how many wins the Orioles capture in 2017, but he did mention that he doesn’t believe the Orioles will get 90 wins.*CBS Sports’ Matt Snyder’s over/under for wins: Over 84.5 winsCall to the Pen’s 2017 MLB Playoff PredictionsJason Reed from FanSided’s Call to the Pen revealed his 2017 MLB playoff predictions back in December.
